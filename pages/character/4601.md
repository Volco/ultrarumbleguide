Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) is a character that excels at pumping damage while also being very good against most of the cast, Strike kendo is very good at 1v1s using her shield and melees its a character that is very underlooked at, kendo is a newer meta character that was introduced in season 12 with one very notable weakness that being kendo is a bit weak against anyone that can grab kendo or anyone that ignores the beta state which seperates kendo from rest of the cast.

## Alpha Skill - Gale Burst

Kendo’s Alpha skill is similar to the Alpha skills of beam-type characters such as Izuku Midoriya or Bakugo. It deals high damage at close range and its effectiveness varies with distance, depending on the opponent’s position. The skill has decent range and functions much like a shotgun blast.

It’s a straightforward ability — if your aim is solid, you’ll have little to worry about when using it. However, avoid using it like a typical beamer’s attack from long range against another beamer, as you’ll likely lose the trade.

Both the aimed and unaimed versions have the same effect; it simply comes down to whether or not you prefer to aim. There’s no functional difference between the two.

## Beta Skill #1 - Twin Palm Strike

Kendo’s Beta skill is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast due to its strong punish potential. Using Beta, you can punish opponents who hit the shield because any physical attacks that lands on your shield they get stopped and staggered making it easier to land your gamma or melee chains, or use it to block incoming projectiles. How effectively you can block and punish depends on your experience and reaction time. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of when to use the shield and when to drop it.

Beta cannot always be used reactively, unlike its Strike counterpart. Keep in mind that you’re still vulnerable to attacks from behind, from the ground, and from wide-area effects. Enemies can also walk through the shield — if they do, they can hit you directly. You can punish these situations using your Melee, Alpha, or Gamma skills.

The punish options differ depending on the situation. For example, if an opponent hits your shield while in the air, you should almost always punish with Gamma, since most of your melee hits will miss. On the other hand, when punishing grounded opponents, you should ideally use melee attacks or short combos for the best results.

## Gamma Skill - Whirlwind Fist

Kendo’s Gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and deliver a powerful clap that deals solid damage. It has some of the best armor in the game and can be used to punish almost any opponent. However, be cautious when using it against players who understand how to fight Kendo — they can bait out your Beta or Gamma and punish you after dodging.

Your Gamma and melee attacks are your primary punishing tools, so try to use Gamma only when you’re confident the enemy won’t evade it. You can also use this skill to gain a bit of extra movement.

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry

</p>

Kendo’s Special Action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great team ability, as it lets you throw your teammates across the map. For example, you can use it to reposition a character with limited mobility, such as Momo Yaoyorozu, or to help a low-HP teammate escape.

However, keep in mind that during your Special Action, you cannot attack. This leaves you vulnerable, so be aware of nearby enemies who can easily punish you while you’re stationary and unable to fight back.

You can also use this ability offensively — for instance, by throwing a teammate forward to quickly chase down an enemy. Once thrown, your teammate can immediately use their mobility skills to follow up. Technically, allies can still attack while being carried without dismounting, but this has limited utility and is mostly for fun. Certain attacks that root the user in place, such as Ibara’s moves, will cause the carried player to dismount.

Interestingly, a Hawks player can even carry a Kendo who’s carrying another teammate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo with a strong lunge when you're close to the opponent. This can be used as an alternative to Beta when Gamma is too slow against faster characters such as Iida, Rapid Deku, or Rapid All Might. You can also choose not to complete the full melee chain and instead interrupt it midway to mix in another skill, such as Alpha or Gamma. Be cautious when using melee attacks, as you’ll be vulnerable to other enemies while performing them. (See more in the combo section.)

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.
