Endeavor is hot af fr fr, but that's not the main point, because pain is the only thing that can prove one's regret and acceptance of guilt, the past cannot be fixed, so look forward, vaporize those tears, and accept the weight of your sins. Forgiveness is not to be expected, shake those delusions away. Fulfill your role, and only then, maybe, you will be forgiven, but remember, that's not your end goal, it's your miracle.

## Alpha Skill - Inferno Fist: Jet Burn

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor punches forward, firing a flame resembling his fist. When the fist collides with a surface, it expands into flames in the surrounding area. Up to two of these flames deal tick damage over time and last for approximately 6 seconds. Tick damage from a flame puddle is applied immediately, meaning aiming at an enemy's feet deals more damage. than normal. Additionally, since the flames persist, it is ideal for use in choke points such as fatal funnels and doorways. Additionally:<br>
<br>
- Projectile Travel Speed: Moderate, lead your shots heavily.<br>
- Pierces through enemies, multiplying damage.<br>
- Tick damage from a flame puddle is applied immediately.<br>
- Only two fire puddles can exist at once. Once a third is cast, the first dissipates.<br>
- Tuning damage affects fire.<br>
- Jump and hover to evade damage while firing.<br>
- Can be used in tandem with Special Action Dash backwards, then canceled into alpha as a backward/kite tool.<br>
- The fire puddle is effective against melee-oriented opponents when cast underfoot or in doorways.<br>

## Beta Skill - Vanishing Storm & Hell Curtain
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique2.png" width="400" />
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique2_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor spawns a tornado at a chosen location, staggering anyone caught within its radius. Once the tornado dissipates, Hell's Curtain forms a ring around the Vanishing Storm. Should an enemy come into contact with the Curtain, they will be pulled toward the center, allowing for strategic Jet Burns on the target. The Curtain persists for an extended period, making it ideal for edge-guarding melee opponents or for use in choke points such as fatal funnels and doorways.

**Vanishing Storm**<br>
- Can be placed at great distances away, on top of surfaces, on walls, and roofs.<br>
- Instantly staggers everyone caught inside.<br>
<br>

**Hell Curtain**<br>
- Damages through walls.<br>
- Features a mirrored downward portion that is typically hidden.<br>
- Place on walls to utilize this portion of the attack.<br>
- An enemy will be permanently trapped if caught between the Curtain and a wall, bouncing indefinitely until death.<br>

## Gamma Skill - Prominence Nova
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch023_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor raises his right arm and begins charging an orb of flames midair. After a short time, the attack can be fired. However, this technique can be charged further to dramatically increase the scale and size of the blast. Once sent forward, upon colliding with a surface, it will explode and gradually grow in size. Enemies caught within suffer damage over time. This move currently has collision issues if it collides with anything other than the ground. Additionally, it will not hit around corners, behind any object or obstacle, or through walls.
- Projectile travel speed: Slow; lead your shots very heavily.
- Hold to increase explosion size
- Hold to extend suspension time in the air.
- Does not penetrate walls.
- Deals no damage when thrown against a wall typically.
- Can be used to intercept enemy wake-up attempts.
- Can be used to snipe airborne opponents if you can predict their movements.
- Detonates mid-air upon reaching maximum distance, useful for edge-guarding distant enemies.

</p>

**Dash**<br>
Endeavor dashes forward at a stable altitude, immediately draining 10% of the gauge and then slowly draining more. This maneuver can be steered left or right.
- Can be canceled with air melee to retain momentum.
- Can be tapped backward and canceled into α as a backward/kiting tool.
- Can be canceled by not inputting any movement and reactivated to make sharp turns.
- Is infinite during the "3, 2, 1, GO" countdown at the beginning of a match. You can spawn on a crate with a near 100% chance to escape.
- Retains all I-Frames. It is 100% safe to wake up and dash away for a short distance.
- Do not sprint off ledges; roll off them instead. This is objectively faster and will not accidentally trigger his Special Action.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301mA2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Hover**<br>
Endeavor suspends himself midair, slowing his horizontal movement speed, and slowly draining your gauge.
- Can be spammed to drain less gauge.
- Strafe left and right while attacking to evade damage.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - High Jump
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch023_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Endeavor leaps upwards or diagonally, draining 50% of your gauge. It is best used mid-air due to a significantly faster activation speed compared to on the ground.
- Castable up to three consecutive times before gauge is fully depleted.
- Goes straight up if input without directional movement.
- I-frames are lost upon casting.
- Gauge consumption occurs only after the move has fully activated.
- Incline can be canceled with alpha, useful for landing on buildings without overshooting.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

Endeavor's melee involves a flaming punch. Opponents struck by it will be set ablaze. This attack requires close proximity to land effectively. The initial hit of the melee is crucial as it serves as the combo starter. Subsequent melee actions hinder combo execution. Therefore, to initiate a combo, press the melee button, pause briefly, and then press it again, ensuring you do not activate the second part of the melee. Also to note, When you use your finish move on an opponent, after it says "opponent knocked out", use your melee to cancel the finish off animation so you can immediately pick up their loot.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Endeavor's aerial melee is a flaming kick that propels him forward. This can initiate a combo, chaining an aerial melee into a standard melee onto one of his abilities. Endeavor's aerial melee also provides movement. When jumping or falling, use the aerial melee for improved mobility. This also applies to Endeavor's special action Dash. Using the aerial melee during a dash grants additional movement and conserves the special action's percentage gauge.

Aerial melee will give you momentum:
- After SA Dash
- After β
- After rolling off a ledge
- After climbing a ledge
- After knock downed wakeup

## Leveling Paths
### Jet Burn Path
Focus on maximizing α damage. Play Endeavor similarly to Nejire or Assault Deku, utilizing alpha's damage for safety and pressure. This playstyle is optimal with alpha tunings and consistent shot landing. Beta should primarily be used to set up alpha. This strategy is particularly effective against aerial opponents like All for One (Young), Nejire, Hawks, Tamaki, Lady Nagant, and Monoma.

</p>

### All's Tornado Path
Jump start your alpha, then go all in on the beta. Not viable in lobbies with plenty of aerial opponents such as All for One (Young), Nejire, Hawks, Tamaki, Lady Nagant and Monoma

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Endeavor's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 100 DP (Projectile), 20 DP (Lingering Fire)<br>
Beta Skill: 10 DP (Per Tornado Tick), 50 DP (Curtain), 50 DP (Upon Activation)<br>
Gamma Skill: 65 DP (Per Damage Tick), 0 DP (The Projectile Itself)<br>
Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1), 100 DP (Melee 2), 200 DP (Melee 3), 400 DP (Whole Melee Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### (Air/Hop Wake-Up) -> Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Beta
A combo you can perform taking advantage of Endeavor's air melee lunge. Whenever someone is far too close to you when you've been hard knocked down, air waking up into air melee is free damage.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 1 -> Beta -> Alpha
Another melee combo to dish out extra damage.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Gamma
Useful when you intend to dish out damage to a wide variety of targets at once.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2301c4-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
Go-to combo. This is Endeavor's bread and butter and his most damaging one.

Mastering the ways of hellflame means that On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell, bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again, we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness, our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back through the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny this time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside, you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard, now can we understand?
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man
So far away, we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames, we carry on

Endeavor can struggle against Deku if Deku lands a Gamma or has very good aim. However, Deku is not a significant threat to Endeavor.

Endeavor does not have significant issues with strike Deku. Although Deku can become difficult to hit when airborne, Endeavor can combo him with Beta and Alpha if Deku's Beta attack misses.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Risky🟡<br>
Deku possesses the most effective melee combat among all characters and sticks to opponents with ease. Assault Endeavor also excels in close-range combat, albeit through different methods. To defeat Deku, efficient utilization of Hell's Curtain and Jet Burn is crucial. Jet Burn must be deployed twice below Deku's anticipated melee chain initiation point. Additionally, position your Curtain so its edge inflicts damage during his melee chain. Furthermore, you can bait him with your gamma ability. Most Deku players disregard opponents and their attacks, often charging in despite being within your Prominence Nova. If your Curtain and Prominence Nova are on cooldown, disengage until they become available. If executed correctly, Deku will be weakened and attempt to flee. At this point, land all available Jet Burns.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Iida's speed and movement make it very difficult for Endeavor to land attacks. Iida needs to be close to attack, so you'll have to be patient and wait for him to come near you, if you see an Iida coming towards you, use your beta ability around you, and he will be hit by it. Also play around your curtain walls and your jet burn flames

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endeavor can have either a rough or easy time dealing with Shoto. If you encounter Shoto, it is advisable to stay airborne, as his Gamma ability can freeze you and inflict significant damage. Therefore, ensure you remain airborne or closely monitor his movements; otherwise, you should be fine unless the Shoto player has exceptional alpha aim.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Shoto can be punished by Assault Endeavor in buildings because Endeavor's Beta ability goes through walls, giving him an advantage. Endeavor does not have difficulty fighting Shoto, and Shoto cannot pursue Assault Endeavor into a building since Endeavor can place a Beta there.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Denki lacks the mobility to evade Endeavor. He cannot effectively use his Gamma ability because Endeavor could be airborne or prepared to use his Beta ability upon Denki's approach.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Tech Denki is one of your biggest enemies, he shreds anyone who camps skybox. Making Endeavor have to stay on the ground. Tech Denki usually keeps his distance from opponents, shooting from afar. If an opponent gets close, he is less effective and will attempt to flee. This provides an opportunity to pursue him and inflict significant damage. Taking him out is your highest priority.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Momo stands no chance against Endeavor due to her having no movement and being a grounded character. Endeavor can just stay in the air and easily land his beta. And Momo can't do anything about it she could go in walls but, Endeavor's beta can just hit right through them.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Assault Endeavor should not attempt to fight a Mirio face to face. Assault Endeavor will have a rough time hitting Mirio due to his movement. If the Mirio holds his gamma, Endeavor can beta and do 1-2 alphas before the Mirio gets away, same thing when Mirio pops out of his beta.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Endeavor's attacks are easy to predict, thus being easy for Mirio to counter him. Mirio is difficult to hit due to Endeavor's abilities. Dodge his Alpha attacks and wait for him to use his Gamma before unleashing your Beta Alpha combo.
<br>

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Tamaki uses his aimed Alpha to grab opponents and deal significant damage. He also becomes airborne with his special action, making him difficult to hit. It is recommended to focus Tamaki when he is unaware and at low health.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Hawks's good movement makes it difficult for Endeavor to land hits. Endeavor's Assault Beta can counter Hawks' Beta. When Hawks approaches, use your Beta so that when he uses his Beta to hit you, he will be pulled in, allowing you to use your Alpha.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Assault Endeavor significantly damages Mt. Lady's hp and gp. When Mt. Lady is in her giant form, Assault Endeavor can use his charged Gamma ability, dealing over 120 damage, which can be further increased with Alpha attacks. Even in her normal size, Mt. Lady must approach Endeavor closely. If she nears an Assault Endeavor who is positioned within a building or using his beta around him, she will be severely punished.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Shigaraki's assault combo requires close proximity. Therefore, when he approaches, you can use Beta to create distance and trap him, allowing you to land Alpha attacks.

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Facing All for One can be annoying, especially when caught by his Gamma while airborne or when he uses a Level 9 Beta. All for One can also possess a movement quirk, making him difficult to hit. Overall, Endeavor does not suffer significantly against All for One.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Facing a Yafo can be annoying, especially when he uses his Gamma ability and him landing his special action attack, which temporarily disables your special actions.
<br>

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Dabi is another character that has a very difficult time fighting an assault Endeavor due to no movement. None of Dabi's abilities will help him against an assault Endeavor. Endeavor can land his beat just as easy as other none movement characters, and Dabi will have to accept defeat.
<br>

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
It is recommended to stay airborne when near Dabi. If he approaches, dash away. He is also an easy target to hit.
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Toga has difficulty landing her Gamma attack. If she attempts her Beta, Endeavor can use his Beta to trap her, allowing him to land Alpha hits.
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
When Endeavor is airborne she will have a hard time landing her beta, and if she tries to gamma you on the ground, you can place a Beta allowing you to combo. She isn't that much of a problem try not to make Toga do her combo on you.
<br>

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Twice's abilities are not ideal for countering an assault Endeavor. Endeavor can easily land attacks on Twice while Twice is using his gamma.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Assault Endeavor faces challenges when fighting Mr. Compress. Mr. Compress can reflect Assault Endeavor's alpha and gamma abilities using his beta. Additionally, Mr. Compress is often airborne, making it difficult for Assault Endeavor to land alpha attacks, and Compress's alpha attack out damages Endeavor's.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri can be very tricky, making it difficult for Endeavor to land his Beta or Gamma attacks due to Kurogiri's teleportation with his Beta.
<br>

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Overhaul should avoid engaging Endeavor in combat. Endeavor possesses superior offensive capabilities, whereas Overhaul's abilities are limited to ground-based attacks, which inflict minimal damage and necessitate precise aiming.
