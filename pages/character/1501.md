Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) is a free-form combo character that excels in 1v1s but hates dealing with superarmor and air sitters. He can struggle to run away sometimes because his combos include gamma, so he often won't have movement if he goes for them. He's extremely good at doing quick burst damage to a target. Indoors and outdoors are both fine for him. He most of the time wants to stick with his team since they can help alleviate the lack of movement options after a combo, or even sometimes make it to where he only needs to use one gamma in a combo since his team is helping chunk the target.<br>

## Alpha Skill - Earth Break
<p align="center">

</p>

This ability has a really good fire rate while spreading into a fan shape to cover a good amount of space. Due to that fan shape, it's also really good for kiting since you don't need to be as precise as if you were on a beamer character. This is your main damage tool when you aren't doing a combo, since you have 5 of them and they recharge really quickly. Do not mash all of them instantly unless you are just trying to instantly frag down a low target, if you wait just a slight bit between alphas, usually the time it takes to do dash jump alphas you effectively have infinite alphas at maximum level.

The alpha being thrown in an arc does allow it cover a deceptive amount of range away from you when a target is running, and you can see them in the distance about to land. If someone's jumping to avoid it you can follow the way they're moving to catch their landing with another alpha so they get hit. The biggest downside about this ability is that due to being a multi-hit it's inconsistent on its damage, but the high fire rate does allow it to make up for that a bit. 

When doing combos that include it you always want to try and land the debris itself for extra damage. His alpha also has very low downpower, making it really good for team combos when your teammate is staggering them especially with its fast fire rate. 

It is also decent to use it to hit airborne opponents when you don't have beta and they aren't in range to get hit by gamma, not the best thing but certainly better than nothing.

If alpha is maxed, it takes 4 direct alphas to finish a downed target.

## Beta Skill - Grudge Shoot
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This is Assault Shigaraki's main "get off of me" tool, since it staggers and knocks down after you land two direct betas (debris). If they're on the ground and you landed the debris itself, you can also ToD (Touch of Death) them with a combo to get them off, since they can't chase you anymore if they're dead. The decay area it leaves pulses 5 times after hitting the ground, wall or a ceiling. It is also important to lead your beta when trying to use it from a distance, if you aim at your opponent you will not hit them, most of time you want to predict where they're going to be able to land it.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the debris and pulses cause the "Decay" DoT (damage over time) effect. The decay from beta lasts for about 10 seconds, during that entire duration anything that would add to the combo meter will stay. For instance the high downpower added by a beta's debris will stay on the opponent for the whole time they have that decay effect damaging them. This is something to keep in mind if you do a combo on someone with only one beta or don't use two beta's debris, it's both a benefit and a detriment to him. On one hand you cannot use beta from a distance then alpha mash and later use beta's debris in a combo later without knocking them down if the decay is still active, on the other you don't need to immediately hit both beta to knock someone down when running from somebody else, you can use the first to stagger them during an armorless movement option then do the other later as they're using another movement option to force knockdown regardless of whether their move is armored or not. 

Beta pulses are actually pretty mid on their own, if someone knows the timing they can just dodge each pulse while sitting directly in it. Where the pulses are really good aside from during stun combos is when you know someone's sitting near a wall or are on a floor directly above you, since you can throw it to where they are and get tiny bits of damage, as well as apply decay and interrupt their healing animation, box opening or teammate pick up they might have been doing.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

If your beta is at maximum level, one beta debris + one alpha debris will kill any downed target without the need to use extra skills, so if the enemy team does not have an instant resurrection character, you can just hit one alpha debris and throw a beta debris at a body to get rid of them.

The beta also initially spawns behind Shigaraki due to where his hand is during the animation, so this is important to keep in mind during combos where you're extremely close to the opponent and have already hit a beta debris, so that way you can avoid accidentally hitting them with the beta as it spawns. If you are close and already hit a beta debris, try to position your camera in a way where the beta won't spawn directly on them and won't hit them before it reaches the floor near them. 

## Gamma Skill - Catastrophe
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Gamma is an ability split in two parts: The initial dash and the final shockwave. The Decay from gamma functions exactly the same as beta's, both the dash and the shockwave give the effect. The dash has negligible downpower, making it actually disgusting (in a good way) for his own combos, as well as being a great extender for team combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the gamma's dash and the shockwave's movement are momentum based, however this matters more for the dash. If you start a normal dash jump and gamma directly at the start you will go further than if you were standing still or just running. Using the gamma's dash mid-air after using another or using his Special Action will result in Shigaraki not going very far compared to running or dash-jumping like mentioned earlier.

The shockwave's hitbox is very egregious, hitting about as high as space hop's maximum height, this makes it a very good anti-air tool and is currently one of his best ways to deal with fast airborne characters that can change their direction on the fly. It's also really good for hitting through walls if you know someone is sitting on the other side of it, similar to using beta's spread to hit through walls, except this can toss someone around.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y4-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

The shockwave is also great at catching a target's wake-up due to it having a large, linger high reaching hitbox. If they're on HP then you can get some good follow ups off of it.

A common misconception currently is that gamma's dash distance increases with level up, the travel distance has been unified across all levels for a while now. 

## Special Action - Collapse Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch015.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that applies a -10% DMG and -20% Defense debuff. This is a really good option for calling out wake-ups since it has pretty similar tracking to melee 3. The defense debuff is extremely good for scaring someone into leaving you alone, making his combos even scarier or working with your team to just annihilate the debuffed target. Jump Special Action is a solid option for calling out someone who's going to jump and press an escape tool on wake-up as well if you know they'll go for that.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Touching a construct with it will immediately destroy them in one hit, which can be useful when dealing with Cementoss's pillars and other obstacles, including natural-generating ones like the buildings in USJ's collapse zone. It can also be used twice in a quick succession while midair for extra mobility.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s3-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain. It's a good option for calling out wake-ups and to just start getting damage up close without using a skill since it does 120 damage. The lunge of melee 3 also has really good tracking so you can just abuse that against someone in close range trying to dodge roll spam if they're close enough. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Shigaraki's air melee is an okay aerial callout option, but is pretty much outclassed and overshadowed by aerial Special Action due to that having better tracking, doing more damage, lowering the targets defense and attack, and sometimes being a better combo starter if you're high enough in the air. It's solid for starting ground combos if they're on shield or you landed it close enough to the ground while they're on HP to follow up with melee 1.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
A good path if you're using alpha, beta and gamma a lot and want more uptime on all of them. You can get whatever you want to level 4 first as preference.

</p>

### Alpha Path
A Path that focuses on alpha DMG while having a good combo start with Beta level 4. High level alpha means more uptime on it since it has an extremely quick reload soeed. With good cooldown management you will never run out of alphas.

### Combo Path
The combo-oriented path, for those who really focus on his combos while also not neglecting the alpha.

### Beta (Debris) -> Alpha Mash
A combo for when you're not in range of a gamma follow-up, or just want to frag someone quickly, or know they're low and you want to preserve beta and gamma cooldowns. Depending on how far you were when you threw the beta you can often confirm two alphas as true follow-up, but it does require predicting their movement with beta in the first place since you have to be a decent bit away for that.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
Same rule as the above of needing them to get guard broken or be on HP for following up on Gamma (Shockwave). Usually only done when you know you need to land two Gamma dashes in order to guard break for gamma's shockwave.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
This is an option, but not a recommended one. Mostly only recommended it if the enemy jumped and you don't have a gamma, since if they're mid-air you can follow up with an air alpha.

### Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
Requires the enemy to be on HP or guard broken by gamma's shockwave. It is also very jank and can sometimes give them i-frames if their model manages to touch the ground as the second gamma dash hits them.

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
A combo hard but possible to perform without Speed Cards. This is a true combo on HP, it only needs Speed Cards for Guard. If they're on HP this just kills 250 HP and 300 HP characters without factoring in any multipliers.

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Alpha
You can hit the debris or hit the spread if you want, both work, usually only get one hitbox of the spread though. Good for when you want to save a Beta and they aren't in range to get a Special Action starter and just want damage on them before they hit the ground

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Melee 1 -> Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
if they get launched close enough to you by Gamma's shockwave, this is a decent combo for damage and a debuff, especially if you want to preserve CDs.
