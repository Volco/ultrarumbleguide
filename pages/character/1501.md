Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) is a free-form combo character that excels in 1v1s but hates dealing with superarmor and air sitters. He can struggle to run away sometimes because his combos include gamma, so he often won't have movement if he goes for them. He's extremely good at doing quick burst damage to a target. Indoors and outdoors are both fine for him. He most of the time wants to stick with his team since they can help alleviate the lack of movement options after a combo, or even sometimes make it to where he only needs to use one gamma in a combo since his team is helping chunk the target.<br>

## Alpha Skill - Earth Break
<p align="center">

</p>

This ability has a really good fire rate while spreading into a fan shape to cover a good amount of space. Due to that fan shape, it's also really good for kiting since you don't need to be as precise as if you were on a beamer character. This is your main damage tool when you aren't doing a combo, since you have 5 of them and they recharge really quickly. Do not mash all of them instantly unless you are just trying to instantly frag down a low target, if you wait just a slight bit between alphas, usually the time it takes to do dash jump alphas you effectively have infinite alphas at maximum level.

The alpha being thrown in an arc does allow it cover a deceptive amount of range away from you when a target is running, and you can see them in the distance about to land. If someone's jumping to avoid it you can follow the way they're moving to catch their landing with another alpha so they get hit. The biggest downside about this ability is that due to being a multi-hit it's inconsistent on its damage, but the high fire rate does allow it to make up for that a bit. 

When doing combos that include it you always want to try and land the debris itself for extra damage. His alpha also has very low downpower, making it really good for team combos when your teammate is staggering them especially with its fast fire rate. 

It is also decent to use it to hit airborne opponents when you don't have beta and they aren't in range to get hit by gamma, not the best thing but certainly better than nothing.

If alpha is maxed, it takes 4 direct alphas to finish a downed target.

## Beta Skill - Grudge Shoot
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This is Assault Shigaraki's main "get off of me" tool, since it staggers and knocks down after you land two direct betas (debris). If they're on the ground and you landed the debris itself, you can also ToD (Touch of Death) them with a combo to get them off, since they can't chase you anymore if they're dead. The decay area it leaves pulses 5 times after hitting the ground, wall or a ceiling. It is also important to lead your beta when trying to use it from a distance, if you aim at your opponent you will not hit them, most of time you want to predict where they're going to be able to land it.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the debris and pulses cause the "Decay" DoT (damage over time) effect. The decay from beta lasts for about 10 seconds, during that entire duration anything that would add to the combo meter will stay. For instance the high downpower added by a beta's debris will stay on the opponent for the whole time they have that decay effect damaging them. This is something to keep in mind if you do a combo on someone with only one beta or don't use two beta's debris, it's both a benefit and a detriment to him. On one hand you cannot use beta from a distance then alpha mash and later use beta's debris in a combo later without knocking them down if the decay is still active, on the other you don't need to immediately hit both beta to knock someone down when running from somebody else, you can use the first to stagger them during an armorless movement option then do the other later as they're using another movement option to force knockdown regardless of whether their move is armored or not. 

Beta pulses are actually pretty mid on their own, if someone knows the timing they can just dodge each pulse while sitting directly in it. Where the pulses are really good aside from during stun combos is when you know someone's sitting near a wall or are on a floor directly above you, since you can throw it to where they are and get tiny bits of damage, as well as apply decay and interrupt their healing animation, box opening or teammate pick up they might have been doing.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

If your beta is at maximum level, one beta debris + one alpha debris will kill any downed target without the need to use extra skills, so if the enemy team does not have an instant resurrection character, you can just hit one alpha debris and throw a beta debris at a body to get rid of them.

The beta also initially spawns behind Shigaraki due to where his hand is during the animation, so this is important to keep in mind during combos where you're extremely close to the opponent and have already hit a beta debris, so that way you can avoid accidentally hitting them with the beta as it spawns. If you are close and already hit a beta debris, try to position your camera in a way where the beta won't spawn directly on them and won't hit them before it reaches the floor near them. 

## Gamma Skill - Catastrophe
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Gamma is an ability split in two parts: The initial dash and the final shockwave. The Decay from gamma functions exactly the same as beta's, both the dash and the shockwave give the effect. The dash has negligible downpower, making it actually disgusting (in a good way) for his own combos, as well as being a great extender for team combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the gamma's dash and the shockwave's movement are momentum based, however this matters more for the dash. If you start a normal dash jump and gamma directly at the start you will go further than if you were standing still or just running. Using the gamma's dash mid-air after using another or using his Special Action will result in Shigaraki not going very far compared to running or dash-jumping like mentioned earlier.

The shockwave's hitbox is very egregious, hitting about as high as space hop's maximum height, this makes it a very good anti-air tool and is currently one of his best ways to deal with fast airborne characters that can change their direction on the fly. It's also really good for hitting through walls if you know someone is sitting on the other side of it, similar to using beta's spread to hit through walls, except this can toss someone around.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y4-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

The shockwave is also great at catching a target's wake-up due to it having a large, linger high reaching hitbox. If they're on HP then you can get some good follow ups off of it.

A common misconception currently is that gamma's dash distance increases with level up, the travel distance has been unified across all levels for a while now. 

## Special Action - Collapse Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch015.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that applies a -10% DMG and -20% Defense debuff. This is a really good option for calling out wake-ups since it has pretty similar tracking to melee 3. The defense debuff is extremely good for scaring someone into leaving you alone, making his combos even scarier or working with your team to just annihilate the debuffed target. Jump Special Action is a solid option for calling out someone who's going to jump and press an escape tool on wake-up as well if you know they'll go for that.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Touching a construct with it will immediately destroy them in one hit, which can be useful when dealing with Cementoss's pillars and other obstacles, including natural-generating ones like the buildings in USJ's collapse zone. It can also be used twice in a quick succession while midair for extra mobility.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s3-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain. It's a good option for calling out wake-ups and to just start getting damage up close without using a skill since it does 120 damage. The lunge of melee 3 also has really good tracking so you can just abuse that against someone in close range trying to dodge roll spam if they're close enough. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Shigaraki's air melee is an okay aerial callout option, but is pretty much outclassed and overshadowed by aerial Special Action due to that having better tracking, doing more damage, lowering the targets defense and attack, and sometimes being a better combo starter if you're high enough in the air. It's solid for starting ground combos if they're on shield or you landed it close enough to the ground while they're on HP to follow up with melee 1.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
A good path if you're using alpha, beta and gamma a lot and want more uptime on all of them. You can get whatever you want to level 4 first as preference.

</p>

### Alpha Path
A Path that focuses on alpha DMG while having a good combo start with Beta level 4. High level alpha means more uptime on it since it has an extremely quick reload soeed. With good cooldown management you will never run out of alphas.

### Combo Path
The combo-oriented path, for those who really focus on his combos while also not neglecting the alpha.

### Beta (Debris) -> Alpha Mash
A combo for when you're not in range of a gamma follow-up, or just want to frag someone quickly, or know they're low and you want to preserve beta and gamma cooldowns. Depending on how far you were when you threw the beta you can often confirm two alphas as true follow-up, but it does require predicting their movement with beta in the first place since you have to be a decent bit away for that.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
Same rule as the above of needing them to get guard broken or be on HP for following up on Gamma (Shockwave). Usually only done when you know you need to land two Gamma dashes in order to guard break for gamma's shockwave.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
This is an option, but not a recommended one. Mostly only recommended it if the enemy jumped and you don't have a gamma, since if they're mid-air you can follow up with an air alpha.

### Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
Requires the enemy to be on HP or guard broken by gamma's shockwave. It is also very jank and can sometimes give them i-frames if their model manages to touch the ground as the second gamma dash hits them.

### Gamma (Dash) -> Special Action
A combo for when you don't have other CDs, that's really the only time you'd do this.

</p>

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Shockwave) -> Beta (Debris)
A combo hard but possible to perform without Speed Cards. This is a true combo on HP, it only needs Speed Cards for Guard. If they're on HP this just kills 250 HP and 300 HP characters without factoring in any multipliers.

</p>

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Alpha
You can hit the debris or hit the spread if you want, both work, usually only get one hitbox of the spread though. Good for when you want to save a Beta and they aren't in range to get a Special Action starter and just want damage on them before they hit the ground

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Special Action
Good for applying the debuff so you can just catch their wake-up after and kill them.

</p>

### Gamma (Shockwave) -> Melee 1 -> Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
if they get launched close enough to you by Gamma's shockwave, this is a decent combo for damage and a debuff, especially if you want to preserve CDs.

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Pulses) -> Alpha
One of Assault Shigaraki's infamous ToD combos. For this combo to work you have to aim the 2nd beta slightly away from the target so that the debris doesn't hit them but the pulses do, since the pulses have low downpower, allowing you to stack more damage than if you went for the debris hit.

Another Assault Shigaraki Touch of Death achieved by missing the 2nd beta's debris but landing the pulses.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Space Hop is an extremely solid tuning on Assault Shigaraki, the extra height from jumping allows him to get so much more distance on collapse hand, a good angle for a beta starter or just alpha dumping a target. The extra jump height also pairs nicely with gamma since you get higher before using it and there isn't too much distance loss compared to most airborne gammas due to some of space hop's momentum affecting it.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Another solid tuning, makes the ToD less of a risk since you aren't just left with your special action as an escape tool, also allows you to wall jump beta someone or wall jump gamma.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Pretty good on both his Awakened (Hero Style) and Cyberpunk skin as well. You can run a bunch of Alpha DMG tunes for some extra alpha damage, you could also just run Beta DMG tunes instead to make direct betas chunk even harder.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>A solid options to run. You should often be getting downs with this character so getting Plus Ultra meter for getting a kill is really nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Another solid option to help with your level scaling everytime you get kills. You can also give the extra cards to your teammates if they're struggling and you're good to go.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Also really solid, this character already gets his CDs back pretty quickly, but now combine that with an automatic Technical Card getting popped because your guard got broken. If you did the ToD and got chunked during it you don't have to wait as long before you can get out of there, it also allows you to do it again to the next person sooner.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>Pretty good for budget builds, it's a Speed Card when your guard breaks, so you can pull out the Gamma (Shockwave) combos on guard or just use the ability to wall run to leave after getting guard broken.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch100_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Assault** <br>Another good option for budget builds, it makes you a bit tankier for a brief period of time.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br>Not a bad option for Assault Shigaraki, he won't be able to use beta in combos, however, it does allow him to alpha-dump someone while they're slowed and aren't able to run as well, and if they do try to run all it takes is 1 beta to knock them down.|

You could also go for Beta DMG tunes but you have 2 beta tunes and an alpha from Technical Kaminari compared to the 3 alphas. If you go Critical Permeation then this lets you refresh your CDs when you get guard broken since that lasts 6.5 seconds so if you're max level you'll have all your abilities back and enough time to pop a Large GP Drink.

Revenge Support works for more aggro playstyles since it keeps you up a little longer, Compression Magic can be used if you're typically just sitting back throwing alphas from high ground/far away letting you just heal your team more often, and Divine Protection if you just want to fight for box off rip. You can also run Ability Manifest if you want a few extra seconds on the cards you use, Crushing PU Charge can be solid for sometimes getting just enough charge to not die at 99% PU meter. Willpower could work as well sometimes, you just need to be careful about not getting your 1 HP wake-up called out.

Assault Deku outranges you, if he's on high ground you really just want to break his line of sight or toss a beta up at where he is to at least get some damage on him if he's close enough to the wall for it to hit, just to maybe force him to move back a bit, making it easier for him to not know where you went. On the same elevation if he gets close or you can close the distance, you can ToD him but if you aren't ever in a position to do that because he rolled your gamma or your beta hit him while he jumped, you can at least use your combos and alpha to chunk him down. If he tries to run with blackwhip out of wake-up, then a melee, Special Action, gamma or beta (debris) are great for calling that out and burning the blackwhip resource. His beta is armored so that is something to keep in mind since the armor makes it harder to get a combo going.

His Alpha hurts, if they try to gamma jump away after a knock down, then trying to catch it with your wake up callout options is a good option but he can just put the gamma on you, preventing this. Sometimes, being in close range can be risky since he has beta and gamma to start combos that will chunk you. If he goes for a beta, whiffs, and doesn't immediately use another beta to cancel the lag this is your best window to either combo or ToD this character.

Similar to Assault Deku's match-up with less range but higher burst damage and no armor to worry about. If you get close to him you have to worry about howitzer, but as long as you're just far back enough you can react to its start up with a beta stun or gamma and then kill him for it.

It's a rapid, you either catch them lacking on the ground or just do an air combo if he's actually in range. Gamma's shockwave is decently nice against this character if they do beta close enough to the ground, as long as it doesn't hit you. It also stops their gamma before it reaches the ground.

A rapid, either you air combo them or catch them lacking on the ground. This character does have a decent way to stop Assault Shigaraki in close range with the car spin so you don't want to be too close if they're on the ground since that easily stuffs out your gamma. Most of the time she's sitting too high in the air to reliably air combo so you're mostly just throwing 2 betas at her to try and get her to back off.

Most of her moves are slow and reactable, the only move that's really going to reliably hit you is her beta, if she tries to gamma you roll that and throw a beta at her then combo to kill her before she runs away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Gamma makes this Match-up actually awful to deal with, you cannot run from him. You can dodge his attacks but he can just keep throwing out hitboxes without a good punish window for Assault Shigaraki most of the time. Gamma's shockwave is just how you deal with him while he's in gamma state since that at least gets you some damage. You mostly want to just wait for him to leave due to his gamma being about to burn out. If he's not in gamma state you can easily just throw a beta at him during an alpha and then combo him. Iida moves too fast with gamma up for this to be reliable due to beta not being fast enough.<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even/Unfavorable🔴<br>
Like most beamers he outranges you. If he's on high ground you just want to try and throw a beta up to him to force him to step back a bit to break line of sight and get to where he can't see you. In mid-close range both of you are fishing for your stuns, and the Match-up can very much come down to "who stuns who first". If you're forced to run and the Shoto has good aim, he is just going to shoot your gamma escape, so be aware of that and try to not leave when you're one-shot. Trying to just gamma at him is also a risk due to the fact that he can just put out his gamma to stun you before you'd hit him or at worst trade in his favor. Since his freeze lasts longer than your stun. He can also just beta you for trying to gamma him which will hurt. A lot of the time in mid-close range you'll just be throwing alphas at him trying to wait for an opening to throw a beta at him, usually when he's doing tap gamma. If he tries to run with his gamma you can try to catch it callout with beta or just throw alphas at him since gamma, Special Action and melee will all get you frozen if you try any of those while he can just gamma again at that point to escape if he does get hit by them.

You probably won't be able to ToD this character reliably because of all the ice at his feet and the fire walls. Beta into Alpha is a big part of this Match-up and will mostly be how you deal with him. Special Action is really nice for getting rid of his betas that are blocking pathways or just about to explode. You can just dodge the explosion so it's not necessary to use your Special Action, but it is useful to know. Avoid enclosed spaces with him.

Roll her air beta and if they "autopilot" grounded beta while you're not in range after, just throw a beta at them then combo her to death. If they don't "autopilot" a beta afterwards just wait until you see them try to beta you again or if they try to alpha you, most of Tsuyu's attacks on the ground leave her pretty vulnerable. Tou can also catch her with gamma if you want to call out her jump, a lot of the time it's easier to chip her with alpha to get a guard break then kill her with gamma shockwave combos.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Do not let this character get close and you're fine. Armor makes dealing with him up close hard. From afar alpha will continually chunk him and you have an easier time getting to high ground and repositioning than him if he chases. This Match-up is where DoT (Damage over Time) not resetting the combo meter comes up the most, and you can use that to your advantage to make him either lose a beta while he's chasing you to high ground or lose an alpha on the ground and then reposition with your beta. Hardening just makes killing him take longer if he's chasing you. He's also pretty free to chase when he's running by throwing alphas towards him. Do not follow him into enclosed spaces.

Difficulty Score: 🔴(Very) Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Hardening is more notable in this Match-up than with Assault Kirishima. If he's hardened, you can attempt to run and hope you can make it so he doesn't find you, since movement-wise he is basically just a rapid masked as a strike. If he's not hardened, then beta and gamma can mess up your combo attempts because of shield and armor. If he's using alpha on you this is your best window to try and start a combo by throwing a beta at him and then just ToD him.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
You are both fishing for the stun win condition. Denki has the upside of being a beamer, making it so he can shoot your escape route, but has the downside of being a short ranged beamer. His movement has very slow startup so he can struggle to chase you if you don't use gamma's shockwave though, both of you have very similar movement so he will be able to keep pace. If Denki tries to run after getting knocked down, his gamma is super slow to startup so you can just call out his wake-up with melee, beta, Special Action or gamma, but sometimes it'll decide to just track you, and you can die for it if you're up close which is why throwing a beta at his gamma startup or just chasing it with a gamma is better.

From afar just try to break his line of sight, throwing a beta at where he's standing from afar isn't reliable if they're running Space Hop like they often do, but if they're not, that is one thing you can do just like against beamers sitting on high ground. Up close they're mostly just going to throw betas and mash alphas at you. If they whiff the betas that is your window to punish them. Your alpha is also great for getting rid of his beta traps. Tech Denki has a fast fire rate on his alpha so he can stun you pretty easily, but if you just mostly try to stay out of its range since lock-on is pretty slow you can chip him down while dodging the alphas. If he gets close enough and you manage to get a beta or gamma just ToD him. If he gets knocked down, Tech Denki's wake-up options aren't the greatest, but beta is a good get off of me wake-up tool he has and gamma can still stun you letting him runaway, mostly just try to call out what you think he'll do on wake-up.

Throw alphas from afar, she can't do anything to you. Don't get close, as she easily shuts you down with alpha up close. Landing betas from afar is also good for getting free alphas on her. If she betas to approach you, alpha usually hits under her beta shield. You can also just take advantage of the fact that she has no vertical mobility outside of possibly Wall Runner and just go up a building. Should go without saying but do not chase her into inside areas.

Alpha spread goes under her shield if she isn't angling it down, and sometimes just ignores it even if she is, this interaction changes every season with no mention. Up close, Kendo just smacks Assault Shigaraki, since she has a super armored gamma. Her range is limited but she has a faster run speed than you, kiting is solid as long as you start with a lead. Mostly just use your superior mobility and don't get close to her to chip her down

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
This character is very difficult to fight as Assault Shigaraki. She has a damage reduction beta that gets stronger the more you hit her. As an AoE character, your alpha and beta vary depending on distance, which lets her charge safely. Her stun alpha can shut down your approaches and stop combo starters. Her super-armored gamma lets her ignore your combos entirely, or even start her own. Strike Kendo's main weakness is range, but she can easily close the gap. She can dodge-roll her beta for endless burst movement, and her gamma combined with air melee gives her very fast mobility.<br>
Against Assault Shigaraki, she has the advantage. He can’t reliably run away, and almost all of her tools either shut down his combos, start her own, or deal heavy damage.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
She's really hard to get close to, and her moves letting her sit in the air makes fighting her from afar really difficult. If you can get close enough just try to attack her during the few windows she's on the ground with beta and alpha, if you get too close she will grab or beta you, both of which have armor. If there are structures you can crouch behind of, you can avoid her alpha.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
All that you have to do is dodge his charge Alpha and Beta, if a Mirio starts running straight at you they're likely going to try and melee, gamma or uncharged alpha you. Just predict their timing and dodge. If he betas you can get a free air combo. If he runs up and tries to melee then whiffs it, this is your best opportunity to just ToD him. If the Mirio runs, you are not keeping up with him. If he chases you the best way to get him to go away is to just chunk him with a combo even if it's not a ToD.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His grab alpha is really strong, it allows him to invalidate your escapes or just start a combo. His beta is tricky to roll since it tracks so hard with a big hitbox, while he's invisible any attack you use will instantly cancel it as long as you hit him, and your gamma will still track him if you're close enough so this is one way to deal with it. His gamma ignores walls and if the Tamaki's framerate is 60 or below this is almost always going to be able to hit you due to high turning making running while really low extremely risky if you somehow do get away from his grabs and betas. His normal alpha is still strong but the range is pretty low for alphas so mostly either try to play out of his alpha range and the only thing he can threaten you with is his gamma which if you see him charging up you can try and quickly close the gap with your gamma.

Air sitter, but could be worse. Most of the time she'll be in range to get pelted with direct alphas mid-air and betas, so just do that to wear her down. If you want to run just throw two betas at her then gamma away, she can struggle to chase you due how her movement works. Another character you just want to chip down until an air combo can just kill her.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
He has a ranged grab alpha that can stop your escape and leads into combos that chunk you. Trying to punish any whiffed betas or gammas of his with the ToD is your best way to kill him, otherwise just try to avoid getting grabbed and slowed, otherwise you will just die.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Assault All Might has a lot of "laggy" options perfect for punishing with alphas. However his gamma makes quite a good wake-up option, so catching it might be hard, but if you time it right you should still be able to catch his gamma. Just beat him with alphas and there's little he can do to win the alpha trade. If he hits you with beta, wake and then do nothing. You'll take a lot of damage but if he tries to go for another beta he will fly by you allowing you to even the score, and if he doesn't you'll be able to mixup when you go for alpha alpha to knock him back.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Rapid All Might's alpha and beta are both very "laggy" and keep him quite still, allowing you to pile on alphas. Rapid All Might's alpha even reduces the down power he takes so you can shoot 3 full alphas before he gets knocked back. His beta is also very predictable for movement so catch that with alphas. Be weary of the suplex as it can catch you very easily for high amounts of damage if you go into the air. Stay grounded, knock him down with alphas, and go in for the wake-up catch to finish the job.

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Aizawa will be able to punish you very hard for almost everything you do, but just keep in mind that if he's comboing a teamate, two clean shots will knock him out of the combo early, and to top it off he might be one of the most prone to wake-up catches in the game so he can't really challenge your beta on wake-up well. If Aizawa goes for alpha pull, melee 1, gamma (which is a common strategy) then spam air melee. You should be able to break the combo on GP after the melee.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Present Mic just out-damages and out-ranges you. Focus on keeping his boomboxes destroyed and don't get close since his beta is very dangerous from up close. Mic can be a easy target for wake-up catches but it can be hard to be in the sweetspot to catch his wake-up due to the worry about his beta, so just stick to alphas here.

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Your gamma allows you to easily line up and go over everything Cementoss builds and catch him with alphas. He can't really injure air targets so just be in the air as much as you can or at least above him on a building, and punish attempts to build up with alphas or a beta. Be weary that going for beta will often trade with his alpha's lingering hitbox, so alphas will often be better.

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endevor is capable of out-maneuvering you quite efficiently with his special action and beta. Additionally, his beta is among the only moves in the game capable of winning alpha trades against Full Bullet and simultaneously is a great combo breaker if you try to catch his wake-up in any situation. Your advantage is that he's a big target for alphas and often leaves himself open for shots with his gamma and special action. Be weary of the enemy having Space Hop as thats super common on Endevor.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Endeavor lost the match-up-defining beta that Strike Endeavor has, but his Assault counterpart has gained strong aerial tools to attack grounded enemies, which results in large damage against you if he gets to jump you or if you miss a key hit. That said Assault Endeavor leaves himself open a lot, with his beta, gamma, and special action all being quite "laggy" which leads to you being able to alpha spam him quite well. Once again be weary of Space Hop.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Hawks can stay quite far from you and is among the part of the cast that wake-up catches with beta often don't work on. However, there is little Hawks can do to beat out your alphas. He also has openings to shoot him if he tries to shoot a gamma or use beta for mobility, since both of those skills have solid "lag" on them. If your aim is strong and you're goot at dodging, then there should be no issues here.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
All she has going for her is Giant Mode, but with the recent cooldowm changes even this is rarely that threatening. Her damage in close range is okay, but you can easily outmaneuver her and win even in melee range. Try to stall for time when she grows big by using your I-frames effectively and rolling when needed and you should have no issues. She's not a threat anymore in small mode and while you always won againsy small mode anyways, now she just can't fight back.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Shigaraki is able to punish you for touching the ground quite well with his gamma and additionally can be quite a slippery target when piloted by a good player, but there's a few key issues here, being that Strike Shigaraki has no options against you when you are in the air, and while you are in the beta animation you are not considered to be on the ground when it comes to receiving damage from his alpha and beta. This means that a beta, beta cancel, gamma with 2 Shigaraki alphas underneath you will often only result in 4 ticks of damage maximum, and sometimes lower. That said, never fight Shigaraki indoors without a good reason to. If you're going indoors with him you better have a massive HP lead or you're gonna be in for a tough time.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Assault Shigaraki has the same issue of being unable to hit you in the air, but Assault Shigaraki doesn't suffer from hitting you during your beta animation with his alpha. When fighting Shigaraki try to be in the air or above him in some way and catch his openings with your alpha or beta. He leaves himself really vulnerable when using beta, gamma tap, and to a lesser extent alpha and special action. Be weary of the explosive combos Assault Shigaraki has and you should have no issues. This character is also very prone to wake-up catches with your beta.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
In a 1v1 situation it's closer to even, but the simple fact that you can very easily interrupt any combos he goes for with your alpha if he misses gamma means you shut down AFO in a team fight. His charge alpha, beta, gamma, and special action steal all have enough "lag" to punish him strongly. Keep yourself grounded and avaliable to roll his gamma or if you are in the air then shoot him twice during the pull animation to prevent the pull from happening. Be weary of wall pierce beta and don't try to approch him while he's standing as his beta acts as a keep away tool Full Bullet can't compete with.
<br>

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
The main issue here is that Tech Dabi disrupts your armorless options quite well, and alpha spam against him is also iffy with his traps and gamma blocking them. When Tech Dabi is close to you it can often be surprisingly hard to create space, as his gamma is a fantastic tool for interrupting your gammas and betas. Fortunately, you can kinda often forget about his existence as he doesn't really pose a threat from range, and can't break that gap easily. If you gamma up you can often ignore his gamma wall and shoot him from above, but Tech Dabi is most often found in buildings where this isn't a option or even if he is outdoors, his beta still blocks your alpha. Keep a eye for Wall Runner on dabis too as they very often carry this special tune.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Dabi trades all the defensive utility for offense, but there are many issues with it. Strike Dabi has gained the ability to fight you from a distance, but fortunately he's bad at it, leaving himself perfectly still for some shots, allowing you to easily and consistently win the alpha trade. Strike Dabi's beta also doesn't have much armor until the grab happens, so if he approches. you can jump beta him away. His gamma also leaves him quite open during activation and makes him probably the most prone to wake-up catches in the game since when his gamma hits 0 while he's knocked back, he will be forced to start the burst as soon as he gets back up so he can't be smart with his invincibility frames most of the time. Some well aimed shots and a beta or 2 should take a Strike Dabi down easily.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tech Toga is yet another character with a bad wake-up game, so she can't really compete with Full Bullet's wake-up catches, meaning that in close range she's quite vulnerable. In range, you have better damage than she does and the range difference often doesn’t matter. Some good clean shots to punish attemps to transform or run away will catch her quite well, and in close range she can't really compete
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Toga can dish out very high burst damage with beta alpha gamma combo, but you can do the same with some alphas so this match-up often comes down to the first hit. Rapid Toga is okay against wake-up catches due to how fast her gamma is but she's extremely bad at disengaging against you since your alpha very easily catches her gamma's endlag, preventing her escape.
<br>

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Ever since Twice lost his combos, he has since been unable to put up a good fight against anyone. He leaves himself quite open to alphas with Twice's gamma and beta "lag". The only time where you should struggle with Twice is when he has a lot of clones, but even then your beta is capable of hitting multiple clones at once and dealing with them quite efficiently.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Mr. Compress has one of the worst wake-up games out of the cast so catching his wake-up should be easy if you get close to him. However, Compress is very hard to get close to, so you'll be relying on alpha for this one. If Compress reflects your alpha it will reflect as the spread shot rather than the aimed shot, so he will often only reflect 2-3 pellets rather than the full shot. Compress also can't fire at you if he's holding beta, and if he holds it all the time just get closer and threaten with your own beta. Mr. Compress can melt you quickly with alpha staggers, but you can also mess him up with some well aimed alphas amd a beta to catch wake-ups.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Overhaul is very threatening up close because his gamma beats out all your moves up close. You do have significantly more alpha damage, but the main issue here is the gamma. An Overhaul that's good with gamma can prevent you from ever escaping since it also hits and stuns through your wall. Overhaul can also heal himself, which makes this match-up even weirder. Overhaul isn't prone to wake-up catches, and in fact, he catches your wake-ups very easily. Against Overhaul just try to stay farther away from higher ground and win alpha trades, as if he gets too close it can be quite hard to escape.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri is able to alpha trade with you, and has some very high damage combos with his beta that he goes for a lot. Kurogiri is also very good at keeping you far away from him, so while his ability to prevent the wake-up catch is bad, it doesn't matter if you never get close enough to begin with. For this match-up it's strongly recommended targeting him first in a team fight due to his revive capability.
