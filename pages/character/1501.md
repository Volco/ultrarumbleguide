Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) is a free-form combo character that excels in 1v1s and creating or extending combos for his team, but hates dealing with superarmor and air sitters. He can struggle to run away sometimes because his combos include gamma, so he often won't have movement if he goes for them. He's extremely good at doing quick burst damage to a target. Indoors and outdoors are both fine for him. He most of the time wants to stick with his team since they can help alleviate the lack of movement options after a combo, or even sometimes make it to where he only needs to use one gamma in a combo since his team is helping chunk the target.<br>

## Alpha Skill - Earth Break
<p align="center">

This ability has a really good fire rate while spreading into a fan shape to cover a good amount of space. Due to that fan shape, it's also really good for kiting since you don't need to be as precise as if you were on a beamer character. This is your main damage tool when you aren't doing a combo, since you have 5 of them and they recharge really quickly. Do not mash all of them instantly unless you are just trying to instantly frag down a low target, if you wait just a slight bit between alphas, usually the time it takes to do dash jump alphas you effectively have infinite alphas at maximum level.

The alpha being thrown in an arc does allow it cover a deceptive amount of range away from you when a target is running, and you can see them in the distance about to land. If someone's jumping to avoid it you can follow the way they're moving to catch their landing with another alpha so they get hit. The biggest downside about this ability is that due to being a multi-hit it's inconsistent on its damage, but the high fire rate does allow it to make up for that a bit. 

When doing combos that include it you always want to try and land the debris itself for extra damage. His alpha also has very low downpower, making it really good for team combos when your teammate is staggering them especially with its fast fire rate. 

It is also decent to use it to hit airborne opponents when you don't have beta and they aren't in range to get hit by gamma, not the best thing but certainly better than nothing.

If alpha is maxed, it takes 4 direct alphas to finish a downed target.

## Beta Skill - Grudge Shoot
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This is Assault Shigaraki's main "get off of me" tool, since it staggers and knocks down after you land two direct betas (debris). If they're on the ground and you landed the debris itself, you can also ToD (Touch of Death) them with a combo to get them off, since they can't chase you anymore if they're dead. The decay area it leaves pulses 5 times after hitting the ground, wall or a ceiling. It is also important to lead your beta when trying to use it from a distance, if you aim at your opponent you will not hit them, most of time you want to predict where they're going to be able to land it.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the debris and pulses cause the "Decay" DoT (damage over time) effect. The decay from beta lasts for about 10 seconds, during that entire duration anything that would add to the combo meter will stay. For instance the high downpower added by a beta's debris will stay on the opponent for the whole time they have that decay effect damaging them. This is something to keep in mind if you do a combo on someone with only one beta or don't use two beta's debris, it's both a benefit and a detriment to him. On one hand you cannot use beta from a distance then alpha mash and later use beta's debris in a combo later without knocking them down if the decay is still active, on the other you don't need to immediately hit both beta to knock someone down when running from somebody else, you can use the first to stagger them during an armorless movement option then do the other later as they're using another movement option to force knockdown regardless of whether their move is armored or not. 

Beta pulses are actually pretty mid on their own, if someone knows the timing they can just dodge each pulse while sitting directly in it. Where the pulses are really good aside from during stun combos is when you know someone's sitting near a wall or are on a floor directly above you, since you can throw it to where they are and get tiny bits of damage, as well as apply decay and interrupt their healing animation, box opening or teammate pick up they might have been doing.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

If your beta is at maximum level, one beta debris + one alpha debris will kill any downed target without the need to use extra skills, so if the enemy team does not have an instant resurrection character, you can just hit one alpha debris and throw a beta debris at a body to get rid of them.

The beta also initially spawns behind Shigaraki due to where his hand is during the animation, so this is important to keep in mind during combos where you're extremely close to the opponent and have already hit a beta debris, so that way you can avoid accidentally hitting them with the beta as it spawns. If you are close and already hit a beta debris, try to position your camera in a way where the beta won't spawn directly on them and won't hit them before it reaches the floor near them.

Beta's endlag can be canceled by rolling.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Catastrophe
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Gamma is an ability split in two parts: The initial dash and the final shockwave. The Decay from gamma functions exactly the same as beta's, both the dash and the shockwave give the effect. The dash has negligible downpower, making it actually disgusting (in a good way) for his own combos, as well as being a great extender for team combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y2-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Both the gamma's dash and the shockwave's movement are momentum based, however this matters more for the dash. If you start a normal dash jump and gamma directly at the start you will go further than if you were standing still or just running. Using the gamma's dash mid-air after using another or after using his Special Action will result in Shigaraki not going very far compared to running or dash-jumping like mentioned earlier. This gamma, of course, doesn't care what the laws of momentum think is impossible because standing perfectly still then using only gamma dash gets you the most distance since it slides Shigaraki mid-air.

The shockwave's hitbox is very egregious, hitting about as high as space hop's maximum height, this makes it a very good anti-air tool and is currently one of his best ways to deal with fast airborne characters that can change their direction on the fly. It's also really good for hitting through walls if you know someone is sitting on the other side of it, similar to using beta's spread to hit through walls, except this can toss someone around. Looking upwards makes Shigaraki fall slower while giving extra height on the flip during the transition to the shockwave. Looking downwards makes Shigaraki fall faster while getting less height from the flip during the transition to the shockwave. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501y4-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

The shockwave is also great at catching a target's wake-up due to it having a large, linger high reaching hitbox. If they're on HP then you can get some good follow ups off of it.

A common misconception currently is that gamma's dash distance increases with level up, the travel distance has been unified across all levels for a while now. 

## Special Action - Collapse Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch015.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that applies a -20% Defense debuff while doing 80 damage to the opponent. This is a really good option for calling out wake-ups since it has pretty similar tracking to melee 3. The defense debuff is extremely good for scaring someone into leaving you alone, making his combos even scarier or working with your team to just annihilate the debuffed target. Jump Special Action is a great option for calling out someone who's going to jump and press an escape tool on wake-up as well if you know they'll go for that since it can start a combo on an airborne opponent. The air version reliably allows for follow ups such as air melee, beta, gamma or a second collapse hand. If the air version is not tracking a target it will usually go the direction your camera is looking at. On a framerate of 60 frames per second that is consistent but with higher framerates you can influence it to go other directions. As of season 14 special action can no longer be ledge cancelled due to changes.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

Touching a construct with it will immediately destroy them in one hit, which can be useful when dealing with Cementoss's pillars and other obstacles, including natural-generating ones like the buildings in USJ's collapse zone. It can also be used twice in a quick succession while midair for extra mobility.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501s3-gif.gif" width="400" /><br/>
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain. It's a good option for calling out wake-ups and to just start getting damage up close without using a skill since it does 120 damage. The lunge of melee 3 also has really good tracking so you can just abuse that against someone in close range trying to dodge roll spam if they're close enough. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1501m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Shigaraki's air melee is an okay aerial callout option, but is pretty much outclassed and overshadowed by aerial Special Action due to that having better tracking, doing more damage, lowering the targets defense and attack, and sometimes being a better combo starter if you're high enough in the air. It's solid for starting ground combos if they're on shield or you landed it close enough to the ground while they're on HP to follow up with melee 1.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
A good path if you're using alpha, beta and gamma a lot and want more uptime on all of them. You can get whatever you want to level 4 first as preference.

</p>

### Alpha Path
A Path that focuses on alpha DMG while having a good combo starter and high reload speed with Beta level 4. High level alpha means more uptime on it since it has an extremely quick reload speed. With good cooldown management you will never run out of alphas.

### Combo Path
The combo-oriented path, for those who really focus on his combos while also not neglecting the alpha.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Catastrophe's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 10 DP (Debris), 10 DP (Collapse Trail)<br>

Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
Special Action: 200 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>

Disclaimer: Combos don't require Rapid Ability Cards, some of the GIFs use them for easier execution.

### Gamma (Shockwave) Combos Notice
Every combo that uses Gamma (Shockwave) as a non-combo ender is mostly only doable on HP. GP is only possible through a delayed hit, Rapid Ability Cards or Acceleration, as well as other elements that give speed buffs like Revenge Rapid.

### Beta (Debris) -> Alpha Mash
A combo for when you're not in range of a gamma follow-up, or just want to frag someone quickly, or know they're low and you want to preserve beta and gamma cooldowns. Depending on how far you were when you threw the beta you can often confirm two alphas as true follow-up, but it does require predicting their movement with beta in the first place since you have to be a decent bit away for that.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Beta (Debris)
This is your "get away from me" option since it knocks, applies decay damage and can be done from the distance.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Alpha -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Beta (Debris)**</a>
A non-true combo, but still an option you can do if you track the target properly.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
This is an option, but not a recommended one. Mostly only recommended it if the enemy jumped and you don't have a gamma, since if they're mid-air you can follow up with an air alpha.

</p>

### Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Special Action
Also an option you can do but not recommended unless you're out of CDs.

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Alpha Masn
Basic bread and butter combo when you don't really feel like doing the ToD (Touch of Death) or don't want to risk it but still want solid damage and preserve other cooldowns for later. 
<p align="center">

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Alpha
Good for team combos or saving a beta in general to snipe with later to force knockdown.

### Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Alpha 
A variation of the above.

### Gamma (Dash) -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Gamma (Dash) -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Beta (Debris) -> Alpha (Debris)
Requires the enemy to be on HP or guard broken by gamma's shockwave. It is also very jank and can sometimes give them i-frames if their model manages to touch the ground as the second gamma dash hits them.

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Special Action
A combo for when you don't have other CDs, that's really the only time you'd do this.

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Alpha
Same concept as Beta (Debris) -> Alpha Mash, but significantly less impactful.

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Beta (Debris)
A combo that's hard but possible to perform without Rapid Ability Cards. This is a true combo on HP, it only needs Speed Cards or Acceleration for Guard. If they're on HP this just kills 250 HP and 300 HP characters without factoring in any multipliers.

</p>

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Alpha
You can hit the debris or hit the spread if you want, both work, usually only get one hitbox of the spread though. Good for when you want to save a Beta and they aren't in range to get a Special Action starter and just want damage on them before they hit the ground

</p>

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Special Action
Good for applying the debuff so you can just catch their wake-up after and kill them.
<p align="center">

</p>

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Gamma (Shockwave)**</a> -> Melee 1 -> Beta (Debris) -> Special Action
if they get launched close enough to you by Gamma's shockwave, this is a decent combo for damage and a debuff, especially if you want to preserve CDs.

### Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Special Action -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris)
A combo to use on airborne targets.

### Beta (Debris) -> Special Action -> Gamma (Dash) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris)
Another airborne combo.

</p>

### Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Pulses) -> Alpha
One of Assault Shigaraki's infamous ToD combos. For this combo to work you have to aim the 2nd beta slightly away from the target so that the debris doesn't hit them but the pulses do, since the pulses have low downpower, allowing you to stack more damage than if you went for the debris hit.

### Beta (Debris) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Beta (Pulses) -> Gamma (Dash) -> Alpha
Another Assault Shigaraki Touch of Death achieved by missing the 2nd beta's debris but landing the pulses.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots: Beta/Alpha DMG > HP DMG > Gamma DMG > GP DMG**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: Assault Endeavor > Assault All Might > Anything Else > Melee Defense**</a><br>
<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: Rapid Bakugo > Rapid Toga > Twice > Anything Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots: Overhaul > Ibara > Kurogiri > Momo > Anything Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Slots: Technical Kaminari > All For One > Nejire > Anything Else**</a>

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br> A decent option for Assault Shig after the collapse hand change. The extra height from jumping allows him to get high enough to reach more places with collapse hand but doesn't go nearly as far as it used to. It does allow for a good angle for a beta starter or just alpha dumping a target from above. The extra jump height also pairs nicely with gamma since you get higher before using it and there isn't too much distance loss compared to most airborne gammas due to some of space hop's momentum affecting it. Do keep in mind though it does make you much more open to characters that punish you hard for being in the air so do not just jump for the sake of jumping.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Another solid tuning, makes the ToD less of a risk since you aren't just left with your special action as an escape tool, also allows you to wall jump beta someone or wall jump gamma.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>The best technical special tuning. At max level it lasts long enough to drink a Large GP Drink to restore your GP, that is, provided the Guardbreaking hit didn't knock you down, in which case you could pop a Small GP Drink. If run with Wall Runner or Space Hop, you will be able to make use of these tunings without dispelling the invincibility, useful to run away or reposition.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Pretty good on both his Awakened (Hero Style) and Cyberpunk skin as well. You can run a bunch of Alpha DMG tunes for some extra alpha damage, you could also just run Beta DMG tunes instead to make direct betas chunk even harder.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>A solid options to run. You should often be getting downs with this character so getting Plus Ultra meter for getting a kill is really nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Another solid option to help with your level scaling everytime you get kills. You can also give the extra cards to your teammates if they're struggling and you're good to go.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Also really solid, this character already gets his CDs back pretty quickly, but now combine that with an automatic Technical Card getting popped because your guard got broken. If you did the ToD and got chunked during it you don't have to wait as long before you can get out of there, it also allows you to do it again to the next person sooner.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>Pretty good for budget builds, it's a Speed Card when your guard breaks, so you can pull out the Gamma (Shockwave) combos on guard or just use the ability to wall run to leave after getting guard broken.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch100_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Assault** <br>Another good option for budget builds, it makes you a bit tankier for a brief period of time.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br>Not a bad option for Assault Shigaraki, he won't be able to use beta in combos, however, it does allow him to alpha-dump someone while they're slowed and aren't able to run as well, and if they do try to run all it takes is 1 beta to knock them down.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>Solid, requires you to melee more which you can use to start a ToD with accel specifically but you cannot go for the standard ToD routes when using a melee. Gamma 2 > melee 1 or Beta > melee 1 would be a good way to set it up while still letting you get follow ups. Catching a wake up with his melee is also another solid way to get acceleration.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br> Extremely good for Assault Shig. There is no reason not to spam the ToD with that on 6 second gamma because 3 seconds, 5.5 second beta because 2.75 seconds. The cooldowns are a slight bit higher if you use everything but still extremely fast. Alpha never runs out while this is active. Given how Assault Shig easily gets a guard break once he gets his hands on someone this isn't hard to activate at all.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_01.png" width="125"> | **Extra Wind** <br> Plus Ultra Merchant when paired with Card Dupe. You get 9% meter per level. It does stunt your scaling for a bit given it has a 30 second cooldown but you get Plus Ultra very consistently.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_00.png" width="125"> | **Symbol of Peace** <br> 56% Plus ultra at level 10 and 60% at level 11. This tuning means you will almost always get plus ultra if you just survive long enough or if a teammate dies before you. It also gives you the meter on revive making it nice for possibly getting plus ultra after a revive.|

            <p>A good skin for Fixer or Critical Permeation, if you go for Fixer you just stack alphas DMG tunes for
                higher alpha DMG output. You could also go for Beta DMG tunes but you have 2 beta tunes and an alpha
                from Technical Kaminari compared to the 3 alphas. If you go Critical Permeation then this lets you
                refresh your CDs when you get guard broken since that lasts 6.5 seconds so if you're max level you'll
                have all your abilities back and enough time to pop a Large GP Drink. Run Space Hop for the Assault
                special tuning.

            <p>If you want to run a Plus Ultra Power Intensified Build and pair it with another tuning that gets you
                plus more frequently this is a good skin for that. You can run PU Power Intensified + Extra
                Wind/Crushing PU Charge. If you don't want to run a Plus Ultra Power Intensified Build you can still run
                whatever double red you want for special tunings but other skins usually give you better mileage with
                one red + a different slot color. The base tuning slots are decent for increasing your damage.

            <p>Shigaraki's best skin for fixer since it has a max level fixer slot. With the tuning layout you can get
                endeavor, tech denki, a hero red of your preference, Tech AFO and overhaul in the fixer column for 17
                extra HP from the skin and higher damage output. The blue slot lets you pair this with wall runner for
                more survivability, Acceleration for extra speed and less lag or Card Duplication for more scaling.

            <h4 class="tune-heading">Villain Costume (Heat)</h4>
            <p>A budget skin that lets you slot your damage tunings of choice (beta or alpha) and two HP DMG tunings for
                more damage on guard breaks. Support tunings like Overhaul and Ibara's to increase your HP. AFO and
                Denki in the technical slots. Assault Endeavor in the yellow slot for extra damage on GP, and Rapid
                Bakugo in the rapid slot for extra gamma damage. For Special Tunings, you get Revenge Rapid and Revenge
                Technical, making it easier to run or not be as vulnerable after a combo without CDs. PU Turbo can also
                be solid in the rapid slot if you want extra PU charge and temporary wall run on down but typically
                you'll get more mileage out of Revenge Rapid.

            <h4 class="tune-heading">In Plain Sight (Default)</h4>
            <p>Another budget build. For the strike slots you can get 2 HP DMG, 2 Alpha or Beta DMG tunes, Technical
                Denki and AFO for the technical slots, Overhaul for the green slot for extra damage on gamma and more
                HP. Assault Endeavor in the assault slot for more GP damage. Rapid Bakugo in the rapid slot and then
                your choice between Rapid toga and Twice for the villain rapid slot. For special tunes, you can run
                Revenge Support/Compression Magic/Divine Protection for the green slot. Revenge Support works for more
                aggro playstyles since it keeps you up a little longer, Compression Magic can be used if you're
                typically just sitting back throwing alphas from high ground/far away letting you just heal your team
                more often, and Divine Protection if you just want to fight for box off rip. You can also run Ability
                Manifest if you want a few extra seconds on the cards you use, Crushing PU Charge can be solid for
                sometimes getting just enough charge to not die at 99% PU meter. Willpower could work as well sometimes,
                you just need to be careful about not getting your 1 HP wake-up called out. Trance Blow can also be nice
                if you just want to melee someone then alpha dump them while they can't reliably get away, you aren't
                meleeing constantly as this character so the cooldown doesn't matter much.

Assault Deku outranges you, if he's on high ground you really just want to break his line of sight or toss a beta up at where he is to at least get some damage on him if he's close enough to the wall for it to hit, just to maybe force him to move back a bit, making it easier for him to not know where you went. On the same elevation if he gets close or you can close the distance, you can ToD him but if you aren't ever in a position to do that because he rolled your gamma or your beta hit him while he jumped, you can at least use your combos and alpha to chunk him down. If he tries to run with blackwhip out of wake-up, then a melee, Special Action, gamma or beta (debris) are great for calling that out and burning the blackwhip resource. His beta is armored so that is something to keep in mind since the armor makes it harder to get a combo going.

His Alpha hurts, if they try to gamma jump away after a knock down, then trying to catch it with your wake up callout options is a good option but he can just put the gamma on you, preventing this. Sometimes, being in close range can be risky since he has beta and gamma to start combos that will chunk you. If he goes for a beta, whiffs, and doesn't immediately use another beta to cancel the lag this is your best window to either combo or ToD this character.

This character has armor on melee, this character has armor on lock-on gamma, this character has armor on uncharged beta, this character has armor on alpha. The only chance you have to ToD this character is when he isn't pressing a button, otherwise just stay away from him if you can.

Similar to Assault Deku's match-up with less range but higher burst damage and no armor to worry about. If you get close to him you have to worry about howitzer, but as long as you're just far back enough you can react to its start up with a beta stun or gamma and then kill him for it.

It's a rapid, you either catch them lacking on the ground or just do an air combo if he's actually in range. Gamma's shockwave is decently nice against this character if they do beta close enough to the ground, as long as it doesn't hit you. It also stops their gamma before it reaches the ground.

A rapid, either you air combo them or catch them lacking on the ground. This character does have a decent way to stop Assault Shigaraki in close range with the car spin so you don't want to be too close if they're on the ground since that easily stuffs out your gamma. Most of the time she's sitting too high in the air to reliably air combo so you're mostly just throwing 2 betas at her to try and get her to back off.

Most of her moves are slow and reactable, the only move that's really going to reliably hit you is her beta, if she tries to gamma you roll that and throw a beta at her then combo to kill her before she runs away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Gamma makes this Match-up actually awful to deal with, you cannot run from him. You can dodge his attacks but he can just keep throwing out hitboxes without a good punish window for Assault Shigaraki most of the time. Gamma's shockwave is just how you deal with him while he's in gamma state since that at least gets you some damage. You mostly want to just wait for him to leave due to his gamma being about to burn out. If he's not in gamma state you can easily just throw a beta at him during an alpha and then combo him. Iida moves too fast with gamma up for this to be reliable due to beta not being fast enough.<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even/Unfavorable🔴<br>
Like most beamers he outranges you. If he's on high ground you just want to try and throw a beta up to him to force him to step back a bit to break line of sight and get to where he can't see you. In mid-close range both of you are fishing for your stuns, and the Match-up can very much come down to "who stuns who first". If you're forced to run and the Shoto has good aim, he is just going to shoot your gamma escape, so be aware of that and try to not leave when you're one-shot. Trying to just gamma at him is also a risk due to the fact that he can just put out his gamma to stun you before you'd hit him or at worst trade in his favor. Since his freeze lasts longer than your stun. He can also just beta you for trying to gamma him which will hurt. A lot of the time in mid-close range you'll just be throwing alphas at him trying to wait for an opening to throw a beta at him, usually when he's doing tap gamma. If he tries to run with his gamma you can try to catch it callout with beta or just throw alphas at him since gamma, Special Action and melee will all get you frozen if you try any of those while he can just gamma again at that point to escape if he does get hit by them.

You probably won't be able to ToD this character reliably because of all the ice at his feet and the fire walls. Beta into Alpha is a big part of this Match-up and will mostly be how you deal with him. Special Action is really nice for getting rid of his betas that are blocking pathways or just about to explode. You can just dodge the explosion so it's not necessary to use your Special Action, but it is useful to know. Avoid enclosed spaces with him.

Roll her air beta and if they "autopilot" grounded beta while you're not in range after, just throw a beta at them then combo her to death. If they don't "autopilot" a beta afterwards just wait until you see them try to beta you again or if they try to alpha you, most of Tsuyu's attacks on the ground leave her pretty vulnerable. You can also catch her with gamma if you want to call out her jump, a lot of the time it's easier to chip her with alpha to get a guard break then kill her with gamma shockwave combos.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Do not let this character get close and you're fine. Armor makes dealing with him up close hard. From afar alpha will continually chunk him and you have an easier time getting to high ground and repositioning than him if he chases. This Match-up is where DoT (Damage over Time) not resetting the combo meter comes up the most, and you can use that to your advantage to make him either lose a beta while he's chasing you to high ground or lose an alpha on the ground and then reposition with your beta. Hardening just makes killing him take longer if he's chasing you. He's also pretty free to chase when he's running by throwing alphas towards him. Do not follow him into enclosed spaces.

Hardening is more notable in this Match-up than with Assault Kirishima. If he's hardened, you can attempt to run and hope you can make it so he doesn't find you, since movement-wise he is basically just a rapid masked as a strike. If he's not hardened, then beta and gamma can mess up your combo attempts because of shield and armor. If he's using alpha on you this is your best window to try and start a combo by throwing a beta at him and then just ToD him.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
You are both fishing for the stun win condition. Denki has the upside of being a beamer, making it so he can shoot your escape route, but has the downside of being a short ranged beamer. His movement has very slow startup so he can struggle to chase you if you don't use gamma's shockwave though, both of you have very similar movement so he will be able to keep pace. If Denki tries to run after getting knocked down, his gamma is super slow to startup so you can just call out his wake-up with melee, beta, Special Action or gamma, but sometimes it'll decide to just track you, and you can die for it if you're up close which is why throwing a beta at his gamma startup or just chasing it with a gamma is better.

From afar just try to break his line of sight, throwing a beta at where he's standing from afar isn't reliable if they're running Space Hop like they often do, but if they're not, that is one thing you can do just like against beamers sitting on high ground. Up close they're mostly just going to throw betas and mash alphas at you. If they whiff the betas that is your window to punish them. Your alpha is also great for getting rid of his beta traps. Tech Denki has a fast fire rate on his alpha so he can stun you pretty easily, but if you just mostly try to stay out of its range since lock-on is pretty slow you can chip him down while dodging the alphas. If he gets close enough and you manage to get a beta or gamma just ToD him. If he gets knocked down, Tech Denki's wake-up options aren't the greatest, but beta is a good get off of me wake-up tool he has and gamma can still stun you letting him runaway, mostly just try to call out what you think he'll do on wake-up.

Throw alphas from afar, she can't do anything to you. Don't get close, as she easily shuts you down with alpha up close. Landing betas from afar is also good for getting free alphas on her. If she betas to approach you, alpha usually hits under her beta shield. You can also just take advantage of the fact that she has no vertical mobility outside of possibly Wall Runner and just go up a building. Should go without saying but do not chase her into inside areas.

Alpha spread goes under her shield if she isn't angling it down, and sometimes just ignores it even if she is, this interaction changes every season with no mention. Up close, Kendo just smacks Assault Shigaraki, since she has a super armored gamma. Her range is limited but she has a faster run speed than you, kiting is solid as long as you start with a lead. Mostly just use your superior mobility and don't get close to her to chip her down

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
This character is very difficult to fight as Assault Shigaraki. She has a damage reduction beta that gets stronger the more you hit her. As an AoE character, your alpha and beta vary depending on distance, which lets her charge safely. Her stun alpha can shut down your approaches and stop combo starters. Her super-armored gamma lets her ignore your combos entirely, or even start her own. Strike Kendo's main weakness is range, but she can easily close the gap. She can dodge-roll her beta for endless burst movement, and her gamma combined with air melee gives her very fast mobility.<br>
Against Assault Shigaraki, she has the advantage. He can’t reliably run away, and almost all of her tools either shut down his combos, start her own, or deal heavy damage.

She's really hard to get close to, and her moves letting her sit in the air makes fighting her from afar really difficult. If you can get close enough just try to attack her during the few windows she's on the ground with beta and alpha, if you get too close she will grab or beta you, both of which have armor. If there are structures you can crouch behind of, you can avoid her alpha.

All that you have to do is dodge his charge Alpha and Beta, if a Mirio starts running straight at you they're likely going to try and melee, gamma or uncharged alpha you. Just predict their timing and dodge. If he betas you can get a free air combo. If he runs up and tries to melee then whiffs it, this is your best opportunity to just ToD him. If the Mirio runs, you are not keeping up with him. If he chases you the best way to get him to go away is to just chunk him with a combo even if it's not a ToD.

A terrible match-up. Mirio is pretty much invincible during alpha, and since all of Assault Shigaraki's moves are quite reactable, he can just counter you with gamma. He's most vulnerable after missing a beta, so if he misses it, you can ToD him if he's in range, but otherwise, there's not much you can do.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His grab alpha is really strong, it allows him to invalidate your escapes or just start a combo. His beta is tricky to roll since it tracks so hard with a big hitbox, while he's invisible any attack you use will instantly cancel it as long as you hit him, and your gamma will still track him if you're close enough so this is one way to deal with it. His gamma ignores walls and if the Tamaki's framerate is 60 or below this is almost always going to be able to hit you due to high turning making running while really low extremely risky if you somehow do get away from his grabs and betas. His normal alpha is still strong but the range is pretty low for alphas so mostly either try to play out of his alpha range and the only thing he can threaten you with is his gamma which if you see him charging up you can try and quickly close the gap with your gamma.

Air sitter, but could be worse. Most of the time she'll be in range to get pelted with direct alphas mid-air and betas, so just do that to wear her down. If you want to run just throw two betas at her then gamma away, she can struggle to chase you due how her movement works. Another character you just want to chip down until an air combo can just kill her.

He has a ranged grab alpha that can stop your escape and leads into combos that chunk you. Trying to punish any whiffed betas or gammas of his with the ToD is your best way to kill him, otherwise just try to avoid getting grabbed and slowed, otherwise you will just die.

He's very manageable just watch out for his armored beta and invincible gamma if you try to start a combo. He's mostly going to be dash jump alphaing so just do the same, timing your alphas for when he lands. If he tries to run with beta just throw yours at him and if that doesn't down him you can chase if you want or just let it be since he has better movement than you. His super jump is terrible for escaping though, good all mights will not be using this to escape but if an all might tries to use it upclose you just kill them for that with a combo.

His alpha prevents him from getting stunned and increases how much he can take before knockdown. It also reduces the damage he takes by 10% which barely matters. If he's holding alpha just start dash jumping to throw alphas at him and try to avoid his. Sometimes it can also be easier to be near the All Might and just constantly swap between being in front of him and being behind him, this can make it hard for the All Might to consistently hit you depending on their camera sensitivity. If he tries to get close to gamma you just throw a beta at him to make him lose the CD. If he tries to beta, you just roll it. This applies to both forms of his beta. Don't get in gamma range. He doesn't have the greatest wake-up options if you knock him down so you can just call out his wake-up with melee, gamma, beta or Special Action.

His special action and alpha make this Match-up insufferable at times, if he grabs you, you get chunked, and his Special Action just prevents you from fighting back or running. If you can land your beta or gamma before he grabs you or negates you with Special Action, you just ToD him. If he's constantly air alphaing the best way to deal with him is trying to kite him with alphas since unlike Strike Shigaraki, your alpha will actually hit his kick off the ground, you can just hit him with alpha debris mid-air or use gamma's dash on him after he kicks off the ground, since the tracking will usually hit him before he has a chance to alpha again during the flip, and from there you can either do an air combo or just go for gamma's shockwave for immediate damage which, if he's guard broken, you can just do a gamma shockwave combo. If he tries to run, your alpha hits his alpha kick so you can use that to your advantage.

Present Mic outranges you, if he's on high ground toss a beta to try and force him back and if his boombox is right next to him also make him get rid of it for a second. If he's on low ground just try to keep breaking the boombox with alpha since it does reduce his DPS. ToD-ing him is the best way to get rid of him but be aware that he can just beta you for hitting him with beta if you're too far to follow up with gamma as a true combo. He will also beta you for getting too close and then chunk you with either alpha or gamma as a follow up.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Dealing with Cementoss can be annoying since all his structures will block your attacks. Assault Shigaraki also can't reliably ToD him because of his alpha towering, so if you do plan to try to go for the ToD getting some damage in advance with alphas is a good way to make sure he dies once you get your hands on him. Mostly just try to avoid his attacks and take whatever openings you can get, if all you can do is go for beta into alpha just take it. Save your gammas for positioning unless you know for a fact you can kill him after landing it. Do not ever follow him into a tight space.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His Special Action and beta makes him annoying to deal with since the former lets him float, reducing your combo damage. His beta is an extremely good get off of me/get back over here tool since it sends you towards him. If he's just floating with his Special Action you can try to throw a beta at him then use your own Special Action, assuming you're in range so your alpha debris shots do more damage, making it a bit easier. If he holds alpha on the ground you get to combo him for it. If he runs be aware that his beta will often be used to cut off your approach angles on him, he does slightly outpace your movement with his Special Action but not so much to the point where you can't keep up. If you try to run be mindful of that gamma since it hits through walls, if you decide to run try to have more than 200 HP so if he does call you out with gamma you at least live and can possibly still get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
His beta is really strong at closing off an area since the wall hitbox can be deceptive to where rolling will sometimes still get caught, if you're in his beta he gets to alpha or gamma you for big damage. If he alpha dumps you after beta be aware that his gamma is really good at catching your wake up option, so try to get away from it while you still have your i-frames. Like Strike Endeavor, he will also be using Special Action to float a good bit. You can do the same thing with a beta stun into your own Special Action to make your alpha debris hit a bit harder. Unlike Strike Endeavor, it can be easier to do an air combo on him since he doesn't have great tools for keeping someone off of him in the air, since his gamma only explodes on impact and does have startup "lag", and his beta only hits the floor so air combos can be pretty good against him if you get enough damage beforehand to actually kill him with one.

He outranges you, you cannot chase him and he will chase you to the ends of the earth. Assault Shigaraki is relying on dodging his beta and punishing him with a ToD during his endlag or catching him by surprise before he notices you at all. If he is in beta flight just roll the slashes or try and knock him out of it with gamma's shockwave, but be aware this is risky since he can just smack you for it and then you've lost a gamma. Hawks's gamma also gives him an easy time chasing you since it allows him to know your location the entire time it's active, as well as making it hard to sneak up on him if he tries to flee while you're marked. He's not hard to deal with, mostly just annoying.

This character can mostly pelt you from the air with alphas making it hard to hit him. If he's on the ground or tries to beta you and whiffs then you just ToD him. If he guard breaks you his alpha lets him just kill you for free since it staggers so keep that in mind when dealing with him. You cannot stun him during his beta while it's moving reliably due to gaining armor at level 7 so it's better to just punish him for missing. His beta is pretty reactable so as long as he's not on top of you can roll it.

Don't be too close to her, despite her alpha only doing 50 per hit it still fires twice per 1 ammo with a fast fire rate, letting her get some really solid damage really quickly in close range. However, after her nerfs, her combos aren't too threatening. The main concern in this Match-Up is her giant form. If she decides to just go big you cannot contest that and just need to try and get somewhere that she can't chase you or hit you. Fighting her in locations where she's small makes her easy to deal with. If you beta her while she isn't using her own beta, she gets combo'd for free. You both have similar movement since she has gamma jump canceling and you have gamma shockwave, so you can chase each other easily on the ground, assault shig does have a better time moving vertically though thanks to the 2 Special Action charges.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Indoors he will win so just don't contest him indoors. He outranges you and his AoE is better than yours. Grab will also chunk your health bar so if he does land that just try to always mix up whether you air-wake or not, since Strike Shigaraki has a 50/50 follow up with his Special Action off his gamma. If he's putting out alphas constantly just dash jump away from them and throw alphas at him or beta stun him, just be aware if he reads you with his gamma or does beta close to the ground he can get to grab you for free. This is one of the few times where using gamma to go up into the air then pelt down alphas and betas is a solid option, but beware this does run the risk of getting you shot by others. If he alpha stacks where you're about to land you can use your Special Action to move away from his alpha stacks.

Throw alphas from afar to avoid being in combo range, let the other Assault Shigaraki approach first. If he tries to gamma at you try to roll it then beta or gamma him and combo for it. You can also throw a beta at him first to just get free alphas.

Don't contest him indoors, be aware that beta can be used to attack you around corners. If you decide to chase him roll his gamma. His jump height makes alphaing him a bit harder but just adjust your timing a bit and you can hit his landings pretty easily. Other quirks can make this Match-up annoying sometimes.

He can sit in the air with an armored damage reduction gamma that also makes him harder to combo max. The only real chance you have to ToD him is if he gets close enough while just shooting alphas. You're mostly staying away from him and just throwing alphas from afar if you can because if he gets close his gamma entirely shuts you down from escaping due to its stun and you cannot force him off with 2 betas.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Alpha and beta do not care about his traps, gamma is the main thing going for him in this Match-up, and his alpha is fiction. If the Tech Dabi is sitting in traps, alpha will break them and beta just lets you stun him. Do not gamma at him or you will get hit by a trap. Just use gamma to break away or hit him through walls. Gamma's shockwave can also be an option for starting combos on him since you can use the flip to maneuver away from traps but still hit him, thoug not really recommended when you just win the ranged game for free.

If he's betaing at you, throw your own at him. If he's alphaing, throw alphas or a beta at him. You cannot do combos that involve gamma, Special Action or melee on him while he has gamma active. He does eat away at his own health so Assault Shigaraki's DoT + his own self damage really melts his HP, so beta into alpha mash to get rid of him.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
She outranges you from really far away so just break the line of sight. Up close betas hurt, but they're easily dodgable, so you can just knock her out of it with a beta or gamma shockwave. Gamma's dash runs the risk of getting hit even if used from behind her. If she's betaing you can mostly just run and throw and alpha then keep doing it. If she takes your blood and transforms near you that is your window to combo her. If she's just using transformation to CD reset you can still combo her for doing it pretty easily, just be aware her transformation does have i-frames on start so she can use that to avoid a stun move. Running from her can be difficult if she has your blood since she has her movement + your movement + hers again. That also applies to chasing.

This Match-up is terrible. If she's CD resetting it's very hard to contest her, since she can just sit in the air for free, and if she turns into Assault Shigaraki she now has the potential to ToD you as well. She's harder to punish for transforming than her tech counterpart since her gamma lets her do it automatically, or she can just go up high reliably before transforming. Trying to bait and avoid her gamma then ToDing her is the best way to deal with her. Running usually isn't an option since she'll just pull you back with gamma.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Basically the same as how you fight most beamers, he outranges you but unlike most of them, he can increase his DPS with his beta clone, but your own alpha easily kills the clone while still being able to hit him. If he's on high ground you can just try to use beta to force him to step back to break line of sight. If he's in mid-range and tries to gamma to close the gap, you can just push him back with double beta or count his gammas and try to stay out of range until he's out or at one of them, then either combo him when he's out or try and force a trade when he's at one then combo him. His gamma is good at catching wake-ups in close range but overall he's not too hard to deal with.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress' alpha stun is his best tool against you since if he gets it, your guard is gone and so is some HP. If he's holding up his beta you just throw alphas at his feet or gamma him if you're close enough, but be aware that he can dodge your gamma if he reacts. If you throw alpha debris or beta debris, they will be reflected at you with higher damage. His gamma is hard to stop unless you've already beta'd him, so if you knock him down there isn't much you can do to stop his escape option if he isn't immediately one shot. If he's sitting on high ground just toss a beta at the wall to force him back. He can easily chase you since his gamma goes really far. If he's just tossing trucks down after gammaing up just try to avoid as many as you can and when he lands try to chunk him for it if he doesn't immediately gamma back up.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kurogiri's gamma remote portal vortex can be difficult to deal with since he can just keep himself out of Assault Shiggy's range. Gammaing up to get in range to throw his projectiles at will often get you beta pulled towards the Kurogiri player, so do not to do this. Mostly just try to predict when he's going to throw an attack at you with his portal vortex or try to immediately break line of sight and lose it. Against Kurogiri himself if you do beta in the air at all you will likely get pulled so doing it on the ground and dodge rolling after the throw is best to avoid getting punished for free. It can go either way but Kurogiri overall has the edge.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Overhaul's ability to heal himself and smack you off of him can make trying to ToD him less enticing to go for. Gamma in this match-up is mostly just for manuevering and breaking off to heal if needed, or just catching a roll with gamma's shockwave while he's on HP to do a gamma shockwave combo. Gamma's dash will get you smacked off of him most of the time. Beta debris into alpha mash is mostly what you'll be using in this match-up combo wise. Try to stay at a range where his gamma is still reactable so you can easily dodge it, dash jump alphas are mostly what you're using in this. If you see him pop special action to heal himself this is where you ToD him.
