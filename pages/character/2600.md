Tamaki Amajiki is a disruptor character who excels at adaptive control and precision zoning. While he has strong tools for punishing and escaping, he isn’t a frontline fighter who can brute-force his way through fights. Tamaki thrives as a reactive fighter, using his Beta vanish, pull, and wall-piercing plasma cannon to disrupt enemies and protect his team from a distance when needed. He’s especially effective at punishing careless opponents who overextend or underestimate his ability to reposition and counterattack.<br>
<br>
Tamaki has significant technical depth, with conditional mechanics that reward players who master his timing and spacing. His Alpha skill offers ranged pokes and flexible grabs, his Beta provides an evasive vanish, and his Gamma beam controls the space from far away. However, because Tamaki lacks sustained forward mobility and has tight cooldowns, positioning and skill management are critical. Along with holding smart angles, these three qualities are often the key to surviving and winning fights.</br>

## Alpha Skill #1 - Marlin Rapier
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch026/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch026_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Marlin Rapier is a precision-based projectile attack that fires a piercing strike resembling a marlin’s horn. It rewards players who can land hits with the tip, dealing significantly more damage and downpower when the strike connects at max range. It is ideal for mid-range poking, and is especially effective at finishing off low-health enemies or pressuring revives from a safe distance. Skilled players will maximize its tip damage by maintaining optimal spacing and timing.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600a-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
<br>
This ability can also pierce through players, meaning that if many are aligned in a straight line, you can hit them all. Although niche, this is an excellent way to utilize good timing skills and seeing the opportunity to lay down consistent damage on everybody on a team.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600a4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Alpha Skill #2 - Octopus Whip
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch026/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch026_Unique1_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

In Tamaki’s Aim Mode, his marlin is replaced by an octopus tentacle, with which he pulls enemies towards him, disrupting positioning and setting up combos. It is a powerful tool for isolating targets or peeling for teammates. It’s especially effective when used from high ground, allowing Tamaki to control engagements while air stalling, and without overcommitting.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600a3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Beta Skill - Octopus Mirage
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch026/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch026_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Octopus Mirage is a sweeping dash attack that deals high damage and applies massive downpower, which also has tracking. On hit, Tamaki vanishes using octopus mimicry, temporarily increasing his movement speed in the process. He reappears either after a short delay or when activating another non-Beta skill. This vanish mechanic makes Octopus Mirage a powerful tool for baiting enemies or escaping pressure during fights. Skilled players will use it to reposition mid-combat, or for stalling when waiting for a group heal with sporadic movement.<br>
<br>
While vanished, Tamaki becomes almost invisible, allowing him to safely rotate or set up his next move. It’s especially effective when used to reposition for escaping unfair matchups or dangerous zones in combination with his Special Action. Overall, this move maximizes his survivability and counterplay potential. It should be noted that while you see yourself as reddish while vanished, enemies will see no color, but keep in mind that you're not fully invisible either.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600b-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Gamma Skill - Plasma Cannon
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch026/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch026_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Plasma Cannon is a multi-shot energy beam that Tamaki fires in a wide arc, capable of piercing through walls and obstacles. It consumes ammo in bursts and can be held to charge, increasing its damage and range. It is effective for zoning, finishing off downed enemies, or pressuring revives from far away. The beam’s ability to hit through terrain makes it a powerful tool for punishing grouped up enemies.<br>
<br>
When held, Plasma Cannon builds up energy and releases a stronger blast that deals increased damage and maintains the same down power, making it ideal for consistent long-range pressure. To note, if Tamaki is hit by Nejire’s skill while charging, the beam instantly reaches full charge, allowing for surprise snipes. Pretty simple skill.<br>
<br>
Be extremely careful when using this ability, as using it leaves you very vulnerable, which can be fatal in the open and often what kills unexperienced Tamaki players.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600y3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action - Wing Claw
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch026/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch026.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

As Tamaki’s vertical mobility tool, Wing Claw launches him high into the air with a swift upward strike using bird talons. It consumes one ammo and has a short 4-second reload, making it a reliable escape or repositioning option. Its height and speed allow Tamaki to disengage from close-range threats and gain high ground in the process. This move also functions as an attack. He kicks the enemy up into the air, which can be used to perform aerial combos. Though it’s Tamaki’s true mobility skill, its low cooldown and vertical reach make it a vital part of his survival and zoning power.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

Tamaki’s ground melee consists of a three-hit combo chain, the first hit, an opening strike that locks targets into the rest of the combo, the second hit, that of which deals the same amount of damage as the first, and finally a rapid triple burst acting as his Melee 3, with the final hit ending the chain. Tamaki’s ground melee is reliable for close-range trades and quick knockdown setups when paired with Wing Claw, Marlin Rapier tipper shots, or even Octopus Mirage to end the combo. It’s especially useful for confirming damage after a successful pull.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/2600m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Tamaki’s air melee is a single strike that deals half of an enemy's downpower gauge in one hit. This is Tamaki’s strongest melee option for burst knockdown setups. It’s ideal to use after Octopus Whip and before launching with Wing Claw. Because of its high downpower, it should be used in the middle of combos in order for Tamaki’s punishing game to be consistent. It also has the quirk of giving you subtle upwards momentum, which can be used to stay airborne for longer if needed.

## Leveling Paths
### Alpha Priority Path
One of the most reliable paths for maintaining pressure and combo flexibility throughout the match. You always opt to max Alpha first, not just for damage but for consistency, as keeping it at Level 4 will leave you short on ammo and size if not cooldown-managed well, especially in extended fights. The alpha tip damage and pull size scale hard with level, and the extra ammo at Lv.4 and Lv.9 gives you breathing room for bad aim in extended fights. Beta comes next, since vanishing is your primary escape and punishment mechanic. Level 4 gives you faster reloads and wider hitboxes, but pushing to Level 9 ensures you can hit it even more consistently. Gamma is last—not because it’s weak, but because it’s safest to use once you’ve already secured control with Alpha and Beta. Once maxed, Gamma gives you zoning pressure to close out fights.

</p>

### Beta Priority Path
A path built around early survivability and reactive control. You start by leveling Beta to 4, giving you faster reloads and a wider hitbox for vanishing, which is critical for dodging early aggression and baiting wakeups. Alpha follows to support your mid-combo setups and give you access to Octopus Whip pulls in or out of the air. Maxing Beta next ensures you can rotate and vanish more often and punish overextensions. Gamma gets brought to Level 4 next to simply help with zoning, while Alpha reaches Level 9 to give you full combo flexibility and tipper potential. Gamma reaches Lvl. 9 last, rounding out your kit with sustained pressure.

</p>

### Balanced Priority Path
One of the most stable and flexible paths for Tamaki across all match types. You start by evenly leveling all three skills to Level 4, giving you access to Alpha’s extra ammo and size, Beta’s faster reload and wider hitbox, and Gamma’s extended duration. Alpha is prioritized next because it’s your most versatile combo tool. Whether you’re ending chains with Tipper or setting up with Whip, the scaling on damage and ammo gives you consistent pressure. Beta follows to give you punish reliability, especially in late-game skirmishes where hiding can become critical. Gamma finishes last, rounding out your kit with sustained zoning from long range once the zone tightens and terrain control becomes important from up above.

## Techs
### Melee 2 and Melee 3 Cancel
Tamaki is able to cancel his Melee 2 or Melee 3, this is done by using Melee 1 with no direction input and wait for the crab claw to disappear (depending on your reflexes you might need to wait a milisecond after it disappears or else you'll be too early) and then hit Melee 2. To test if you're doing correctly, quickly press backwards movement input after Melee 2, if you did it right you will move away with no endlag, and sometimes might even miss the hit.<br>
<br>
To expand this to Melee 3 just use Melee 3 after Melee 2 and use a directional input after to cancel it. If you plan to do another melee chain after a Melee 3 cancel, then the hitting the next melee should be done pretty much at the same time as you press the directional input to cancel Melee 3, otherwise on GP they might gain i-frames. Also make sure to cancel Melee 3 a bit late or else they can get i-frames that way too.<br>
<br>
In simple terms: Melee 1 -> Wait a milisecond after the crab claw disappears -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Wait a milisecond -> Directional Input

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Tamaki's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 100 DP (Normal Marlin), 250 DP (Marlin Tip), 250 DP (Octopus Grab)<br>
Beta Skill: 500 DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 100 DP (Per DMG Instance), 500 DP (Maximum Hits)<br>
Special Action: 100 DP<br>
Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1, Melee 2), 200 DP (Melee 3), 400 DP (Chain Total)<br>
Air Melee: 225 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Beta
A combo that works if the target is against a wall, otherwise the beta will likely miss.

</p>

### Special Action -> Alpha (Grab) -> Beta
The most effective combo for a Tamaki that doesn't want to overcomplicate with melee cancels.

</p>

### Alpha (Grab) -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 Cancel -> Beta
The most damaging combo that isn't situational, making use of the melee cancel tech to squeeze some extra damage.
<p align="center">

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 Cancel -> Alpha
Tamaki's 2nd strongest combo, only held back by how niche and situational it is, as you either gotta hit the first melee on a target that's slightly off-the ground or on a downwards slope. It also takes some time to be executed which means that you will leave yourself vulnerable to enemy attacks for a while.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 Cancel -> Beta
The strongest of Tamaki's combos, but that suffers of the same issues as the previous combo with how situational it is.

<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots (Option 1): Present Mic > Strike Dabi > Strike Kendo > Strike Deku > Strike Endeavor**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots (Option 2): Strike Kendo > Strike Kirishima > Strike Hawks > Strike Shinso > Strike Denki**</a><br>
This is the only side of Tuning that needed two options, as the amount of Beta Attack Power+ tunings that are in the game should be taken advantage of if possible. But if not, the best Beta DMG tunings have been ordered for what else they offer.<br>
<br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: Assault Endeavor > Assault All Might > Assault Ochaco > Assault Kirishima > Assault Deku > Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: Rapid Twice > Rapid Mirio > Rapid Toga > Rapid OFA Deku > Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots: Overhaul > Ibara > Kurogiri > Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Kaminari > Aizawa > Dabi > Toga > Else</a><br>
**</a><br>

### Special Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">*Note: Toga is very inconsistent with tunes and functionality since some only work while not transformed (notable examples being revenge skills or willpower). The bias of this list is towards tunes that either she always has access to or that their benefits outweigh the drawback of not being able to activate while transformed.*</a><br>

The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch007_01.png" width="125"> | **Electrification** <br>Tamaki’s Pull in Alpha into a full Melee string frequently leads into Guard breaks. Electrification lets you follow up with Beta without fail. It is a good combo starter once they are on HP.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>His melee chains are fast and consistent, and Acceleration turns them into momentum tools. The movement speed helps reposition for tipper Alpha or Pull Alpha into Beta setups, while attack speed tightens his combo windows.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Willpower gives Tamaki a second chance to vanish or reposition. It’s especially valuable when you’re mid-combo while low health and get interrupted, and surviving longer lets you escape on wake up with Wing Claw, a quick move that could hopefully stall until a team heal comes.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch023_01.png" width="125"> | **Full Burn** <br>His PU is a combo extender. Full Burn gives you more time to keep piling on the combos, just with more damage; chain combos are common with this tuning, and beta becomes especially powerful during his PU.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br>His melee confirms often lead into vanish or Alpha setups. Perception lets you track enemies post-hit, making it easier to follow up. It is common to track them with gamma, charging it up until they stop moving, thinking they’ve reached a safe distance, and releasing it.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>If his Guard gets broken mid-combo or during a bait, Critical Permeation gives him a brief invincibility window to reposition or escape, much like Willpower. It’s a strong defensive tuning for players who like to play reactively or bait pressure.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Wing Claw and Air Melee benefit from vertical control. Wall Runner gives Tamaki easy access to high ground, letting him set up Alpha pull angles from above or escape pressure when Super Jump tech is used.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Space Hop makes Wing Claw launches more evasive and improves the consistency of air melee follow-ups. It’s also a great tool for contributing to the air stall nature of the character, and can straight up no diff certain characters when used in tandem with his alpha pulls.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Simple tuning. Embrittlement turns melee related combos into debuff starters, making follow-up Alpha or Mirage hits more lethal. At max levels this allows you to do more damage without the need to melee again, as the Embrittlement is still in effect (~15 seconds).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Crushing PU Charge rewards his natural playstyle by accelerating PU gain after successful eliminations. This tuning is especially strong in mid-to-late game when Tamaki starts securing solo picks or third-party finishes.|
