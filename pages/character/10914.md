<h1>Wall Run Guide</h1>

<h2>The basics</h2>

Wall run is a state of the characater that allows them to run up walls. This state may be accquired with Wall Runner, PU Turbo Special Tuning Skills or Rapid cards. Iida has Wall Run as his passive ability. This is a massive mobility boost for most characters and this guide is here to explain how to take full advantage of this tecnhique.

<h3>Step 1: Starting a Wall Run</h3>
You start wall running by doing one of 2 things:

1. sprint twards a wall and just keep holding sprint. Your character will automatically transition into a wall run and in some specific cases such as with red kiri beta and when iida has someone on his back this is the only way to attach to the wall for run.
2. Second way to start the Wall Run is to grab on to the wall by pressing jump when facing a wall and holding into the wall. Once you have grabbed on to the wall simply input sprint and your wall run will begin. You can input sprint in any direction from this point to begin the wall run in any direction.

</p>

<h3>Step 2: Wall Jumps</h3>

<p>When jumping off a wall you will get increased momentum when compared to a normal jump. This momentum often carries well into most air melees or into some character specific actions for a huge boost like when ochaco has float on or when combined with momentum amplifier abilities like tech mirio alpha and rapid bakugo alpha.</p>

</p>

<p>The next thing to mention is super jumps. These can be preformed by inputting jump while wall running and then during the jump animation you let go of your directional input. This will cause you to jump super high off a wall and again this often has character specific interactions which will (hopefully) be mentioned in the character guides.</p>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/wr4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<p>If you do the inputs and simply detach from the wall that means you let go of your directional input too early. If you reattach immediately or dont get that much hight that means you let go of your directional input to late. Learning this timing can feel rather strict when first learning it but its actually quite lenient.</p>

<p>There are a few quirks to super jumps that i will bring up.</p>

1. if you do a super jump too soon after attaching to a wall you will get a significant amount of forward momentum.
2. after the high jump any directional input will cause your gravity to be increased dramatically however this can be avoided by using a air melee for most characters.
3. super jumps can be done in all directions off a wall not just up. You can do what is called a sideways super jump by doing the input when holding far right or left instead of up. Diagonal jumps are also possible and thes are generally better than jumping off the wall traditionally.
4. you can change the direction of your super jump by inputting a new directional input right before letting go of your directional input for the jump which lets you transition from a sideways wall run to a vertical super jump extremely fast.

<h2>Step 3: Increasing distance and momentum<h2>

When going up a long wall you can chain multiple super jumps together but if you do it too quickly you wont go up as fast. Its best to wait roughly half a second in-between each super jump for maximum speed and efficiency.

</p>

When going for distance its important to note that the increased gravity effect from a forward input can be avoided with a air melee so by doing sideways super jump or forward super jump (done by preforming a normal super jump extremely quickly after attaching to a wall) you can input a air melee and then immediately start holding in the direction you want to go in order to get increased distance from your directional input without suffering from the increased gravity effect.

</p>

<h2>A few important final notes.</h2>

There is a tech done by manually ending your sprint and inputting a grounded action at the same time that lets you use some grounded moves on a wall. Here are a few examples. However in practice few of these are actually that useful but keep a eye out for these strategies in the character guides (for any guidemakers reading this reach out and ill give you clips for what this tech does for your character if you want)

</p>

For flight based characters its recommend to turn auto dash on if you plan on combining them with wall runner. Flight and wall run have issues when trying to attach to a wall that makes the combination hard to manage but turning on auto dash fixes this issue since you immediately start wall running upon grabing on to the wall skipping the dash input entirely.
