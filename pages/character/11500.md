Lady Nagant is the first ever sniper character introduced to the game. She combines extraordinary fire range and high DPS with very good mobility and combo potential. Utilize her scoped shots to catch your enemies off guard and deal them devastating headshot damage.

## Alpha Skill - Hollow Point Shot
<p align="center">

</p>

Lady Nagant’s alpha is pretty basic beaming ability, but it has two main gimmicks that differs it from similar abilities. 

1. The range on her Alpha has an incredibly long range: if you see an enemy, you can hit them. 
2. After landing a hit, it causes a second tick of true damage that ignores shields and deals damage directly to the opponent's HP. This damage can be increased by Tunings, strike cards and other multipliers.
3. Achieving level 4 and level 9 of your alpha makes your shots fly faster.

Other than that, her alpha features higher projectile speed which makes it easier to shoot people at long distances. On the other hand, the size of the projectile is slightly smaller than usual, which is honestly not a big downside.

## Beta Skill - High Angle Fire
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch115/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch115_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Beta skills is an AoE ability. It has a long stun window which makes it an excellent combo starter. High Angle Fire ignores rooftops and obstacles. It deals damage in a high cylinder which makes it possible to hit flying opponents if they are not too high up. Keep in mind that your beta skill is also a good tool to stop melee agression if you use it right beneath you. In a lot of situations it wil also force your opponent to leave their cover and open up for your shots. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500b-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Keep in mind that the endpoint of your beta is exactly the same surface that you aimed at, so shooting a rooftop doesn’t make it go through and hit the people inside, but if you are standing inside and shooting the floor, people on the rooftop will get hit.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500b2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Your beta can also hit people behind the tall buildings, even if you don’t see them directly. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500b3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Gamma Skill - Kickback Shot
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch115/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch115_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Lady Nagant’s gamma skill is her primary movement ability. If you press it midair, you will get an impulse in the opposite direction. It will send you flying with high speed. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500y-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

If you press it standing on the ground, it will knock back your opponent, dealing formidable damage. It has 500dp, which will guarantee a knockback even to armored enemies. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #1 - Scope Mode
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch115/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch115_1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

If you press your special action button, you will enter scoped mode. It has two magnifiers: 3X and 7X. During aiming, you can press your alpha ability button and shoot a different kind of projectile. It doesn’t scale off your alpha, which means leveling it up doesn’t make it any stronger. This shot can pierce your opponents, but could be blocked with shield abilities and obstacles. Scoped mode shots do not consume your alpha charges.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hitting a head of your enemy will deal extra damage

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

In scoped mode, you can see a laser sight leading to the center of your screen. Keep in mind that this laser sight is visible to your enemies. If you waste too much time aiming, you will warn your enemies of your presence and they will try to evade.

Keep close attention on your laser sight. It shows you a real trajectory of your bullet’s flight and may warn you that your bullet will hit an obstacle.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500s3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Jumping or using air walk during Scoped Mode does not cancel it, but using any other quirk skill or roll dodge does. Remember that scoped mode saves your magnifier settings. If you use a 7X magnifier, the next time you enter scoped mode, it will stay on 7X which may be problematic if you need to hit a shot at close range, so you should switch back manually in the meantime.  

## Special Action #2 - Air Walk
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch115/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch115_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Airwalk is a double-jump passive ability. It significantly increases your air time and survivability, as well as helps you steady your crosshair to land airshots more consistently.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500s4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

You can reset airwalk by jumping off a wall or using your gamma.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

Lady Nagant’s melees is a three-hit chain that ends with a high precision projectile rifle shot. It has a long range and deals 70 damage.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The bullet direction could be adjusted to a certain degree up and down. Another interesting interaction is the fact that the last shot can activate all melee-based Special Tuning skills like Acceleration and Trance Blow.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500m2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Her Air melee propels her down which may be useful to get back on the ground faster and evade the attacks.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path

</p>

In this path, you will rush to get a second gamma charge first, increasing your mobility and sniping capabilities. After that, you will level up other abilities one by one. In Fact, Lady Nagant does not have a strict levelling path. The only rule I can advise is to always go for gamma level 4. The second charge on her gamma is crucial for your gameplay. After hitting that level, you for any other key levels. It depends on your playstyle and the situation you found yourself in. 

Alpha is good for beamin, beta is good for setting up combos and area control, gamma is good for moility. Rushing any of them after hitting 4-4-4 is not a bad choice. Just make sure you prioritize reaching level 9 on any of those skills ASAP.

</p>

Beaming path is for the more confident players who don’t feel like they need extra beta radius to help and kick start their combos.

## Techs
### Air Shots
The fundamental Lady Nagant’s Tech is Air Shots. Lady Nagant has a lot of ways to prolong her air time and landing these shots is quite easy, if you get used to it. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Air shot heavily depends on your aerial movement speed and direction, so it is crucial to maintain control over it. If possible, try to save your air walk to adjust your movement right before the shot.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### CQB Quick Scopes
It doesn’t take much time to zoom in and press your alpha skill so close quarter quickscopes is a viable strategy that allows you to deal a severe burst damage while. In situations like this, keep in mind that the delay between entering scoped mode and shooting is minimal, so you can shoot right after pressing your special action.

</p>

## Bunnyhop
After sprinting or walking forward proceed to press your jumping and air melee controls to speed up your grounded movement significantly.

<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>

### Air Melee → Melee 1 → Melee 2 → Alpha = 181 damage (only possible on HP or Guarbreak)
This combo is only guaranteed on even surfaces or in cases when you push your enemy down from high ground and requires you to be very quick. In this combo, enemies receive i-frames before the bullet does the second instance of damage. In a situation when they touch the ground later, the second instance of damage occurs and enhances this combo by 12 more damage.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/basic+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta → Beta = 184 damage
This combo is the easiest to execute, but at the same time, it wastes too much of your resources while dealing pretty mid damage. It’s good against multiple targets or in case you don’t have a direct LoS with your enemies.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/basic+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee → Grounded Gamma =  220 Damage (Only true on HP) 
This combo is essentially the same as the previous but should only be used if you don’t have your scoped shot ready or want to push your opponent as far away as possible.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (3 hits) → Alpha → Alpha = 283 damage
This is the most consistent combo in her kit. Beta completely locks your opponent in place making it much easier to deal with and shoot them with your alpha.
<p align="center">

</p>

### Air Melee → Melee 1 → Melee 2 → Scoped Shot = 294 damage (Hard to execute on GP)
The same combo as the one you saw before, but this time you use a scoped shot as a finisher. It’s easier to perform on HP and it helps if your enemy stands on the elevation so you push them down from it (even a small one counts). The timing is very strict, if your enemy spams air recover, but still possible. Landing a headshot is also possible, but usually you wouldn't have enough time to aim so it heavily depends on your luck.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (2 hits) → Alpha → Alpha → Alpha = 329 damage (Not True)
If your enemy tried to leave Beta area, but still got hit by two of its ticks, you can have enough time to shoot them three times, while they are stunned. This combo deals more damage but is far less consistent since you can’t control your opponent’s movement. While this combo is not true, it’s still useful to know because it still works on certain characters if you catch them mid-air.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee → Scoped Shot = 409 Damage (On GP) | 252 Damage (On HP) 
This combo has different damage on GP and HP targets because opponents without GP tend to flinch, hiding their heads. Headshot is still possible, but unreliable. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500c7-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (3 Hits) → Headshot = 467 damage
Locking your enemy in place makes them a significantly easier target for your scoped shot. Landing a headshot may be still challenging due to the visual noise from your beta, but even landing a bodyshot makes this combo deal 310 damage. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/11500c8-gif.gif" width="400" />

</p>

### Beta (3 Hits) → Alpha → Headshot = 554 damage
A devastating combination that ToDs the targets with up to 300 HP. It is not too hard to execute, especially if you practice it in training mode. Tuning and Strike characters in your team will make this even more deadly.

</p>

### Aimed Mode sensitivity
Standard aimed mode sensitivity is not nearly enough for Lady Nagant’s scoped mode. It feels too slow and unresponsive. Unfortunately, the game does not have dedicated settings for Scoped Mode, but you can slightly increase your aim mode sensitivity to make scoped mode a little more comfortable. Keep in mind that changing this setting will affect all characters, but you can find a middle ground and set it around 120 for PC. 

### Optimizing your gamma reload
Your gamma is your primary mobility skill so make sure you don’t waste both of your charges unless you really need it. The cooldown only starts off after you touch the ground. Intentionally landing on a high ground or using you melee to land faster helps you reload it.

Another key feature is that your gamma only loses a charge after you make the shot. A start-up animation does not consume you gamma charge which mean you can be knocked out of it and keep the charge, or delay your gamma until the second charge replenishes

### Air Stalling
As a sniper with great mobility and airtime, do not doubt the fact that people down there hate your guts and will jump you the second your feet touch the ground. So it’s for your better to delay that “touching grass” moment as long as possible. Wisely utilize your airwalk, betas, gammas and gamma delays to stay in the air for maximum amount of time.

### Camping
Your headshots deal devastating damage and you want to hit them as frequently as possible. And what's the easiest target to land a headshot on? Surely a target that does not move. Unfortunately for you, MHUR is a chaotic and fast paced game, so your enemies usually don’t stand on one spot… unless they are… let’s say opening a box? Saving a civilian? Poor Kota? You can always sit half across the map in front of those points of interest and wait for them to foolishly consider it’s safe to lock themselves in a long interacting animation so you could capitalize on it.

### Early game aggression
Scoped mode shots do not scale off your alpha quirk level, so it is already at the peak of its power in the very beginning of the game. Landing a headshot in the very beginning of a match will make your underlevelled enemies vulnerable, easy to chase and finish off. Even if they get resurrected by their allies, they would waste too much time of the looting stage which will have a severe consequence on their later gameplay. And hey, also it gives you two free level up cards.

### Hiding your laser sight
Sometimes you want to hold a long angle using your scope, but laser sight makes it too obvious and gives out your position. You can intentionally aim at something closer to you, while keeping said angle in your LoS. This will help you stay unnoticed and catch your enemies off guard with a flickshot.

| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Space Hop will help you to save your gammas and gain altitude without having to waste any resources. Space hope does not cancel your scoped mode, which makes it useful to set up air shots, but right now there is no possible Costume that allows you to run it with QFR or SpA Reload Boost. This fact makes you more alpha reliant. Air Walk does not trigger it for the second time.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>This tuning significantly favours early game aggression and makes your early kills more rewarding.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>A tuning that saves you from certain death is universally good, but we still decided to add it since a lot of Nagant’s costumes have strike slots in it. Willpower is one of the best choices for situations like this.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Ebrittlement** <br>This tuning makes air melee into headshot combo even deadlier. It loses to QFR in general, but could be good if you want to center your gameplay around this combo.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>Acceleration is another melee-based tuning that significantly speeds up your animation. It’s good for easier combo execution and faster fire rate. It also unlocks you melee looping.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>We don’t specifically recommend going for this tuning, but since both of her base PURs have a green slot option, Divine protection (or Revenge Support) are good if you don’t have any souls to buy a different color version.|

                solid and you can experiment with Space Hop.</p>

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
A battle against the original Deku is primarily a test of your aim. But even if they aim better than you, you still have your beta combos, longer alpha range and superior mobility.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
The Full Bullet matchup is very similar to the one against the original Deku, but he is much easier to punish due to his complete lack of horizontal mobility.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
OFA Deku is a complicated and dangerous match-up since his beta can easily track your gamma mobility and air walk. His mobility makes him a hard target for your snipes and alpha beaming, but you can still come out on top if you catch him in your deadly beta combo or with a well-timed grounded gamma.
<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
A battle with Strike Bakugo is somewhat similar to Assault Deku, but his Alpha is significantly less consistent. You can keep them at long range and melt them down without serious problems.
<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Just like OFA Deku, Rapid Bakugo's mobility is unpredictable. He can create a lot of visual noise disrupting your aim and chase you quite hard. But again, he is very vulnerable to your beta combos, especially mid-air. Another useful tip is using your air walk to jump over his gamma and punish it with a Beta combo.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Uraraka is very stationary when she throws cars and casts her gamma. Take advantage of this moment of vulnerability to snipe or beam. Use your air walk to evade cars; being hit by one mid-air is not a pleasurable experience.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Assault Ochako has very limited and predictable mobility, making it easy to land your alphas and sniper shots. She’s also stationary while attacking with her own Alpha. A common tactic that Assault Ochako uses is creating levitating islands to collect themselves and heal. Nagant can easily jump over them and snipe Uraraka.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Iida is a melee-heavy character with a comparatively small HP pool which makes him very vulnerable to your attacks and the true damage your alpha deals. Usually Iida wouldn't be able to close the distance with you. But if he does, you should utilize your deadly beta combos and grounded gamma to make them back off.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Shoto Todoroki is a grounded character which is already a big advantage for you. Your beta ability can hit him behind his walls and he has a hard time shooting back. Use your airwalk to jump over his gamma if he catches you on the ground.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Technical Todoroki is usually focused on area control. As Lady Nagant, you usually don't feel the need to stay in one particular area, so you don't feel pressured by his betas. Focus him if you see him in the open.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tsuyu's invisibility makes her much less predictable, but her 250 HP pool makes your combos extremely impactful against her. She's on a small list of characters who can sustain a chase against you. And she can be pretty scary if she finds you in a vulnerable state. But landing a couple of good shots is devastating for her.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Kirishima is a melee fighter who severely lacks speed against you. He's easy to snipe or beam, and even if he uses his hardening, you can still knock them off using your gamma.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Strike Kirishima is a dangerous opponent. His shield blocks your damage and he possesses a dangerous burst combo paired with enough mobility to effectively chase you down while covering themselves with a shield mid-air. You can still deal severe damage to him from long range, but getting closer is risky, especially since hardening ignores your beta stun.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Denki is a mid-ranged fighter. You can still harass them from afar, and his lack of mobility won't let them escape from you quickly enough. Just make sure they don't catch you off guard with their gamma.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tech Denki has a start-up animation on his gamma and casting beta locks him in place. You can easily abuse those moments and punish him. His alphas may be annoying at long range, but since he has to be in aimed mode during lock-on, you can easily snipe him back.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Momo Yaoyorozu is another grounded character who has a hard time escaping your alpha and snipes. You can hit her behind her shield once it is placed on the ground with your beta.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Monoma has a very annoying gamma that protects him from your shots. The match-up could go both ways depending on what skills he copied, but him having 250 HP doesn't help him.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kendo's shield can completely block all your damaging options. She wouldn't be a problem until the final circles, where her lack of mobility will be compensated by the small size of the circle. But once it gets to this point, your options in a 1v1 are trying to spam and break her shield or evading her gammas for skillful quickscopes or melee combos.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Kendo usually can't reach you. She's easy to hit when using her gamma. The match-up is winning unless you charge her beta and end up being too close.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ibara is a grounded character with no mobility which makes her an easier target for your snipes. You are easily winning by keeping out of her alpha range or up in the sky, where she can't see you.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Rapid Mirio is the squishiest character in the game; he's extremely vulnerable to headshots and combos. Abuse his vulnerable frames to shut him down completely.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Technical Mirio is an extremely dangerous threat. The main reason why is the fact that all your attacks are counterable. Make sure you punish his every defenseless frame and make sure not to accidentally hit his counter. Baiting him by intentionally missing your shots is also a good strategy.
<br>

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Amajiki is a low-ranged fighter with limited mobility. Keep away from his grabs and melt him down with your alphas. Make sure to punish him for using his cannon every time you see it is possible.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Hado has a long air time, but she is also very slow in her flight, which makes her an easy target for you.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Shinso may be dangerous if he catches you, but you can easily punish him for grabbing someone with his alpha. Just try to generally keep out of his range.
<br>

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
All Might has a huge hitbox and the range of his alpha is much shorter than yours. His start-up and end lags are easily punished, and your beta hits through his gamma.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Even though All Might's hitbox is still huge, he can now compensate for it with high-speed mobility. It allows him to fly up closer to you, grab you with his gamma and slam you down. This match-up heavily depends on how consistently you can hit his beta flight. Also, if you see him standing on the ground and spamming alphas, don't be shy and land a headshot.
<br>

## Armored All Might <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch200_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Armored All Might has one of the best mobility kits in the game. He can sustain the chase and catch you with his beta stun, which can be deadly. His alphas can pressure you a lot, especially since they deal high burn damage. Your win condition here is good aim and beta combos.
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Aizawa's erasure may be quite annoying, but he's not that good against you if you are in the air. Attack him from afar and try to protect yourself with beta combos and grounded gamma if he finds you on the ground.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Mic has high beaming potential, but he can't really get too close to you unless you let him. Even at close range, you should be winning by using your beta combos.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Cementoss usually tries to keep on top of his pillars. Jump over them to land an easy headshot.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Huge hitbox and predictable mobility make him an easy target. If you see him trying to cast his gamma, it's also an easy headshot. You have enough time even if he aims it directly at you. Skillful Endeavors will land their spears on you, but it is not fatal.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
A match-up very similar to base Endeavor. Keep away from the range of his alphas and it will be enough to win. Both his beta and gamma abilities are not threatening to you.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Hawks' movement is predictable and his hitbox is rather big. He lacks the tools to get closer to you safely and deal significant damage. Hawk's gamma is also easily punishable.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Hawks shares a lot of his default version's vulnerability, but he has much higher damage potential and a slightly larger HP pool. You are fine as long as you keep out of the range of his combos. Hawk's Beta also has a punishing endlag.
<br>

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score (Small Form): 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Difficulty Score (Giant Form): 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Mt. Lady in her small form has no means of getting close enough, and you outdamage her easily even if she closes the distance.

In big form, she becomes a huge punching bag. Landing a headshot will usually detransform her.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You can't be realistically hit by any of his abilities apart from melee and Special Action because of your airwalk. He is usually easy prey. Even if he rushes you with his armored gamma, you can still knock them back with grounded gamma.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Most of Catastrophe's power lies in his combos. Keeping away from it shuts down his damage potential against you.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Thousand-Hand Break) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var2_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Both his alpha and beta may be rather annoying, but he will have a hard time landing them if you keep him at long distance. His gamma locks him in the animation, so you can easily headshot him. The real problem is chasing and finishing him off because his tuning builds make him very sustainable, but winning the fight and forcing him to run is usually not hard.
<br>

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
AFO has a huge hitbox and low mobility; he is an easy target at long range, but he can still punish you severely indoors, so he shouldn't be disrespected. Another layer opens up if he copies a good set of quirks, but the match-up is still generally winning. If you catch an AFO using his gamma, it may be an easy headshot.
<br>

## All For One -Youth Age- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch201_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Young AFO has very predictable mobility, but he can still be a threat if he catches you with his gamma. You can knock him off it, but only if you land a headshot which may be challenging in this situation.
<br>

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Dabi essentially can't touch you most of the time. Your beta ignores his gamma shield, so it is not hard to kill him unless you trap yourself inside a building with him.
<br>

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You are easily winning if you keep out of his beta range. If he catches anyone in his beta, it opens an opportunity for a headshot for you.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Tech Toga is generally a winning match-up, but it heavily depends on her copied quirks. She can counter you if she has decent blood in stock.

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Even though her movement is rather predictable, she has quite a damaging combo that steals your blood. If she manages to land it first, she turns this fight into a mirror match-up.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Poor man has no damage at long distance. And you still outdamage him in closed quarters. His movement is also predictable and easy to punish.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Compress is hard to hit, but since you have long air time, he can't reliably hurt you either. Melt him down slowly and catch him with a well-timed beta combo.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kurogiri may be annoying, but you generally out-DPS him with your alphas. He's very vulnerable to your headshots if you catch him using his gamma.
<br>

## Lady Nagant <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch115/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch115_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
A mirror match-up: the player with better aim wins. If you see another Lady Nagant using their scoped mode while standing in one place, you can easily land a headshot.
<br>

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
He can't hit you at long range. At close range, you can always stay on the high ground and air walk his gammas.
