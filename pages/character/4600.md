Itsuka Kendo is a character that excels at pumping damage while also being very good against most of the cast, Assault Kendo struggles against any flying units or any character that can get a high ground such as Cementoss, as well as having difficulties compared to other characters when it comes to fighting a full team and against the newer meta, but excels at being very good at individual fights using her shield and armored gamma.

Kendo's alpha skill is similar to a beamer's alpha such as Izuku Midoriya's or Bakugo's. Kendo's alpha does high damage upclose and varies at distance depending on where the opponent is with decent range, functionally working like a shotgun skill. It's a simple skill, if your aim is good you have little to worry when using this skill, but don't use it like your classic beamer from far away against another beamer, or else you'll be the one losing the trade.

Both aimed and unaimed version have the same effect depends if u want to aim to shoot or not really upto you it has no change.

Kendo's beta skill is what separates her from rest of the cast with its punish game, using the beta you can punish people if they hit the shield (mostly with physical attacks), or you can also use it to block any projectile that is coming in your way. How much you can block and punish depends on your experience and your reaction, over time you will likely develop a sense and feeling as to when to use the shield and when to drop it. Beta cannot be used on reaction every single time unlike its Strike counterpart. Be aware you're still vulnerable from behind, from attacks that come from the ground, and from attacks that affect a wide area. Characters can walk through the shield, meaning that if you abuse it, they can just walk past it and hit you directly. Be careful since even if you drop your shield and attack when they get too close, they might dodge your attack and punish you with theirs.<br>

Kendo's gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and clap you for some good damage. It has one of the best "armor" in the game and can be used to punish anyone. However be careful when using it against players that know how to fight Kendo, as they can wait for you to use beta or gamma to get a free punishishing move on you after dodging. Your gamma and melees are your own punishing tools, so try to use gamma when you feel confident the enemy won't dodge it.<br>
You can also use this skill for a bit of movement.

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry
<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo's special action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great special action for your team because you can throw your teammates around the map. For example, a character with no movement such as Momo Yaoyorozu or a player that is low on HP, however during your special action you cannot attack anyone so beware of your enemies when using it because they can punish you, since you're standing still and you cannot fight back. This can additionally be used to chase an enemy by throwing your teammate so that they are quickly yeeted forward and can use their mobility right after. Technically, allies can still attack while you're holding them and not dismount, but this doesn't have much utility and it's mostly silly, though some attacks that force the player to stand still like Ibara's moves do dismount the player. Interestingly, a Hawks player can carry a Kendo that is carrying the other teammate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo that has a good lunge when close to the opponent. An alternative you can use after beta when gamma is too slow. You can also not go for the full melee chain and instead interrupt it halfway through to sneak another skill such as alpha. Be careful when using melees as you're a sitting duck for other enemies while performing them.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.
