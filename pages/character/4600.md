Itsuka Kendo is an assault character who excels at pumping damage and control. While she can hit hard, she isn’t a pure brawler who can recklessly push into every fight alone. Kendo thrives as a team-oriented fighter, using her shield, and punishes to create openings and protect her allies.
She is especially effective at punishing careless enemies who underestimate her due to her limited mobility. Assault Kendo has a lot of technical depth, with many mechanics and techs that reward players who master her full kit. However, because she lacks strong movement options, positioning is extremely important when playing Kendo - holding good ground is often the key to surviving and winning fights.

## Alpha Skill - Stone-throwing Fist

<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo’s Alpha skill is similar to the Alpha skills of beam-type characters such as Izuku Midoriya or Bakugo. It deals high damage at close range and its effectiveness varies with distance, depending on the opponent’s position. The skill has decent range and functions much like a shotgun blast.

It’s a straightforward ability — if your aim is solid, you’ll have little to worry about when using it. However, avoid using it like a typical beamer’s attack from long range against another beamer, as you’ll likely lose the trade.

Both the aimed and unaimed versions have the same effect; it simply comes down to whether or not you prefer to aim. There’s no functional difference between the two.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Beta skill is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast due to its strong punish potential. Using Beta, you can punish opponents who hit the shield because any physical attacks that lands on your shield they get stopped and staggered making it easier to land your gamma or melee chains, or use it to block incoming projectiles. How effectively you can block and punish depends on your experience and reaction time. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of when to use the shield and when to drop it.

Beta cannot always be used reactively, unlike its Strike counterpart. Keep in mind that you’re still vulnerable to attacks from behind, from the ground, and from wide-area effects. Enemies can also walk through the shield — if they do, they can hit you directly. You can punish these situations using your Melee, Alpha, or Gamma skills.

The punish options differ depending on the situation. For example, if an opponent hits your shield while in the air, you should almost always punish with Gamma, since most of your melee hits will miss. On the other hand, when punishing grounded opponents, you should ideally use melee attacks or short combos for the best results.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Big Fist Grip
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and deliver a powerful clap that deals solid damage. It has some of the best armor in the game and can be used to punish almost any opponent. However, be cautious when using it against players who understand how to fight Kendo — they can bait out your Beta or Gamma and punish you after dodging.

Your Gamma and melee attacks are your primary punishing tools, so try to use Gamma only when you’re confident the enemy won’t evade it. You can also use this skill to gain a bit of extra movement.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600y2-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch046.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Special Action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great team ability, as it lets you throw your teammates across the map. For example, you can use it to reposition a character with limited mobility, such as Momo Yaoyorozu, or to help a low-HP teammate escape.

However, keep in mind that during your Special Action, you cannot attack. This leaves you vulnerable, so be aware of nearby enemies who can easily punish you while you’re stationary and unable to fight back.

You can also use this ability offensively — for instance, by throwing a teammate forward to quickly chase down an enemy. Once thrown, your teammate can immediately use their mobility skills to follow up. Technically, allies can still attack while being carried without dismounting, but this has limited utility and is mostly for fun. Certain attacks that root the user in place, such as Ibara’s moves, will cause the carried player to dismount.

Interestingly, a Hawks player can even carry a Kendo who’s carrying another teammate.

</p>


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo with a strong lunge when you're close to the opponent. This can be used as an alternative to Beta when Gamma is too slow against faster characters such as Iida, Rapid Deku, or Rapid All Might. You can also choose not to complete the full melee chain and instead interrupt it midway to mix in another skill, such as Alpha or Gamma. Be cautious when using melee attacks, as you’ll be vulnerable to other enemies while performing them. (See more in the combo section.)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600m-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.

## Leveling Paths
### Hybrid Path: Alpha
A path for players who want to use their alpha. Ideally you also want Beta 4 for easier punished and Gamma 9 afterwards. The downside however is that your gamma will be low level so you need experience before you start leveling alpha first.

</p>

### Punish Path
For players that want to play Kendo as a punish character or if you don't feel like aiming. The only downside is that your alpha will be low level. This is the recommended path for newer Kendo players.

## Techs
### Air Extension: Alpha Gliding
If can cancel Kendo's beta skill midair with alpha, you will keep your aerial momentum, essentially letting you move faster. This works very well when it comes to chasing since you can attack at the same time you keep yourself fast.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Extension: Fall Boost
When falling off a building or ledge, using Air Melee quickly after will give you a nice boost in forward momentum. If you do it too early (right at the edge), you will lose momentum.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Extension: Extended Alpha Gliding
By combining Alpha Gliding with Air Melee you can lunge forward for greater distances.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600t3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

You can get consistent access to Alpha Glide Extensions on terrain by equipping 3 Forward Jump HT+ normal tunes on Kendo (possible with 2, but consistent with 3) without the need of Acceleration or Rapid Ability Cards. The characters that give this tuning attribute are Ochaco Uraraka (Rapid), Hitoshi Shinso and Himiko Toga (Rapid).

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Itsuka Kendo's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 25 DP (Per rock), 100 DP (Full Hit)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 500 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3-4: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 150 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Alpha
A combo that takes advantage of melee's 400 total downpower to sneak in an extra alpha. This combo works fully on both HP and GP, but on GP the window is significantly tighter to execute, however with consistent practice it can be hit. Attack Speed buffs such as Acceleration or Rapid Ability Cards can make it easier to fully land on GP.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Since Kendo lacks a bit of mobility you can use wall runner to compensate the lack of mobility. It also removes the need of collecting various cards such as technical and rapid cards.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Kendo's melee is good, you can use embrittlement to amplify your damage. You can activate it using any sort of melees, pretty self explanatory. It also allows your teammates to deal more damage to the enemy you've struck.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>A solid option that makes Kendo speedy and makes it basically impossible to dodge her alphas.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Since Kendo does a lot of damage, you can use fixer to do even more damage with the right build and the right slots. If you can pair this with Embrittlement you've got yourself some absurd damage.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>A budget alternative to Wall Runner that works well for very specific builds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br>Trance blow can be used to slow enemies using your melee to do insane damage, however depending on character and chaos around you it can backfire.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Recommended tuning for somewhat experienced Kendos, more levels are always good, especially if you can KO people easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Recommended for experienced Kendos who can KO people easily, getting PU per KO always helps you get away from situations where you would not be able to otherwise.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_00.png" width="125"> | **Symbol of Peace** <br>Useful for extra survivability, especially in the early game.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>This tuning works with every character, as surviving lethal attacks with 1 HP is always useful. However, you gotta be wise with how you use your i-frames, Kendo's mobility is quite low, so this tune will only delay your death if you don't play wisely.
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>Since Kendo does absurd damage, revenge strike will always work with her. Getting a damage boost upon being guardbroken is nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support** <br>Heals you when guardbroken, this tuning is useful if you like using the Poison Mist to your advantage. This tuning is very specific and useful, recommended for newer Kendo players.|

                good
                special slots. You can pair Trance Blow and Fixer on this build for pure damage. High-Speed
                Replenishment works too, however that is totally up to you.

            <p>This costume is what you should use if you want to use Embrittlement on a budget build. The costume
                has a
                good combo of everything: Damage, Defense and Reload. You can use Embrittlement + Fixer or
                High-Speed
                Replenishment totally up to you. The downside of this costume is the lack of red slots.

            <p>If you want to use Willpower recommended using this costume as it has good normal slots. For budget
                builds this is one of the best costume to use as it has pretty much everything you need except for
                Embrittlement which you can compensate for with Willpower.

            <p>Recommended using this costume if you want to make a build purely made for survival, as you can
                combine
                Willpower with Revenge Assault on this build. You can also use Trance Blow in this build, although
                not
                recommended. You can even use Symbol of Peace too however it's also not recommended.

            <h4 class="tune-heading">Casual Wear (Dangerous)</h4>
            <p>If you want to build a PUR build and are looking for damage with good special slots, you can use this
                costume as it has good mix of everything, the only downside of using this costume is the lack of
                blue
                normal slots. Recommended combining embrittlement with HP Sucker on this build as this costume has
                alot
                of red slots.

            <p>You can use Embrittlement on this costume combined with Wall Runner or GP Sucker. It's a decent
                Embrittlement + Rapid slot costume if you are looking for some sort of movement while having
                Embrittlement.

                with
                Compression Magic, Warp Heal or Reinforced Revive to help out your team, however only use this
                costume
                if you are a really really passive Kendo and very new one.

                with
                decent secondary slot. Recommended tunes for this costume are Embrittlement and Compression Magic.

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Deku can outrange you with his alpha, but you can outdamage the deku upclose, both Deku and Kendo have equal mobility, however Deku can use his blackwhip to help him outrange you and get away from you. Assault Deku match-up is pretty much even, it really depends on what you and the Deku does, what you have is more damage while Deku has a tiny bit more movement, you can use your damage and melee to your advantage to win this match-up.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Pretty much same thing as Assault Deku, however on this match-up your best bet to win is melee and gamma hits, both Kendo and Deku have the same amount of damage pretty much speaking, however one thing to watch out for in this match-up is Full Bullet's gamma, the rest is pretty much same as Assault Deku match-up.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Try and expect his gamma and beta at low gears, while at high gears this matchup is very different as you should watch out for everything Deku does and have to play by his mistakes. The best thing you can do in this match-up is to not let Deku get a melee on you and to not let him escape.
<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Both of you guys have insane damage and both of you are practically the same character, however the match-up rules are pretty much same as fighting an Assault Deku. One thing you can do different on this match-up is blocking the gamma and catch his Special Action.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Avoid this fight. Rapid Bakugos are flying around all day long, your alphas barely reach them, and your combos don't work so long as he's flying, he also has amazing mobility to escape from you. Your best bet is to either avoid this match-up altogether, jump him, or try to exploit his mistakes. Going inside a building might help you if he gets overconfident, as his low HP makes him fragile. If you manage to land a few good strikes and he's upclose, don't let him escape, or else he will be a pain to deal with later on. 
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even/Unfavorable🔴<br>
On this match one thing u gotta watch for is the knee air melee from Ochako and Gamma, the rest depends on what Ochaco you face and what you can do. However on this match-up you may need few a few rapid cards to kill her.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
You can block her beta easily, both of you have the same amount of damage and almost same amount of battle movement. One thing you gotta watch out for in this match-up is to not let the Ochako float you whenever you can and to not let Ochako make an island to heal herself, the rest are self explanatory, block the beta, watch the gamma, use your melee properly and never ever let Ochako staill with her island or run away.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While you can block everything an Iida does, because of his speed it's difficult to deal with everything, and even punish a good Iida, it depends on you skill and how good you are at punishing. This match-up can be both even 🟡 or 🔴 unfavorable depending on your and Iida's skill, however one thing you must do on this match-up is punish a burnt iida.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both you and Shoto are close range demons with insane damage, however on this match-up you gotta be careful to not get hit by his beta and his gamma whenever you can. Same rule as fighting an Assault Deku pretty much besides that.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You counter everything Shoto does... literally. You can block his gamma, his beta and his alpha. Everything he does you can counter it using your shield, however one thing you gotta be careful on this match-up is to not get frozen during his alpha, besides that this matchup is very very favorable for kendo.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This matchup is very favorable for Kendo, if you see a Froppy coming your way you can use your alpha, and if she comes very close, you can even use your melee to stall Froppy close to you, just use your melee properly on this matchup and Froppy can never touch you.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This match-up is very easy for Kendo, as you can block everything except for gamma, which is the only thing you gotta watch for in this match-up, besides that this matchup depends on how good on you are at blocking and dodging.

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
This match-up can be even 🟡 depending on the player, both of you have armored gamma, however the biggest difference in this matchup is that Kirishima can use his armored move in the air, and that's a game changer in this match, and also the fact that Kirishima has a better shield and combo than yours while also having similar melees. Red Drive also outdamages you while having largely more movement then you do. This match-up is all about who punishes and uses shield properly.

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both of you have insane damage, both Denki and Kendo have practically the same movement, both Denki and Kendo are practically the same character, however one thing you gotta watch out for in this match-up is that you don't wanna get stunned as it means death or sometimes being very low after his combo, you gotta use melees beta and alphas properly on this match-up while avoiding getting stunned by Denki.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you, however if you see a Denki sniping above a building don't get greedy, let him come to you instead, both of you have similar combos, his stun combos don't hurt as much as his default counterpart, upclose you outdamage him by a lot, and he cannot do too much to you while you also have your armored gamma. On this match-up, one thing you should watch for is his gamma, just don't let Denki get away whenever he tries to by using melee or gamma.

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you simply by the fact you have armored moves and better melee. Besides that, on this match-up just never get into a building with Momo spamming cannons and you should be all good.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
It's Monoma he can do everything you do but better, with infinite movement you have to be really good with melees and your skills to kill good Monomas as they have no CDs. There's not much to say he's just Monoma, however you can use your combos to kill him quickly, as he has low HP.

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is about never getting hit by melees and gammas. It's literally you,so whoever plays best the Kendo game will win, though tuning can change things a bit.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
This match-up is unfavorable to you simply because Strike kendo has way more movement than you, however you can win this matchup by blocking the Kendo's beta and gamma to punish her, same thing for the melee. Both of you have equal shield however there is one advantage you have with your shield, that is you can block forever while she cannot. This matchup can be 🟡 Even. Depending on your opponent it can be Unfavorable or Even, just remember to never get caught by the melees, beta and gamma while playing on Kendo's mistakes.

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is even for Kendo as she can outdamage an ibara upclose, however on this match-up what you gotta watch for is to never fight an Ibara long range, as Ibara counters Kendo at this distance thanks to her alphas special piercing property. However, you counter Ibara upclose.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you as Kendo can dodge everything Mirio does, just punish everything he does, especially his beta. The rest of this match-up is pretty self explanatory just punish everything he does and do good dodges. 
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable/Even🟡<br>
This is a match-up which Kendo can most definitely win, however you have to be really careful as ;irio has better damage and movement then you do, and a counter to punish you. Patience is key in this match-up even if he runs away that's okay in this match-up as you can fight again anyway knowing when he will use his counter and waiting for it is a way to win this match-up. Winning is definitely possible but you have to be really careful, also remember to block his beta with your own if you see it coming. If you can predict his counters, he's not that difficult, otherwise it's unfavorable

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both of these character have combos that hurt hard, however Tamaki has better mobility than you do. This is a match-up that really depends on how fast you can close your distance, your best bet here is to kill him as soon as possible before he can run away and try not to get grabbed as that can hurt a lot, however your beta blocks everything he does, but blocking his gamma may require very high level beta.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to Kendo as she can punish everything a Nejire does while having insane damage. Nejire cannot do too much to you no matter where Nejire is as long as you have a few rapid cards in your inventory. However, while grounded, one thing you gotta watch for in this match-up is Nejire's gamma as it can hurt Kendo a lot and can ruin your momentum, besides that this match-up is all about using your rapid cards properly to kill a Nejire, she cannot do much to you because your gamma counters Nejire pretty hard, even if Nejire is in the air one gamma pretty much counters her, recovering or not.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is even because both you and shinso have insane damage and he's trying to do the same thing as you are getting up close and using beta for damage, however in this match-up there is one thing you gotta watch out for, and that is if a Shinso has Space Hop tuning this matchup can be 🔴 unfavorable too depending on your dodge and punish skill. This match-up is self explanatory, never let Shinso learn and punish him upclose as he can't do much at that range.
<br>

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to Kendo because you can block everything besides alpha. There is just one rule on this match-up and that is to know when All Might is gonna gamma and never let it throw you away as All Might can punish you hard if he does that, so on this match-up your best bet is to punish the beta and gamma while trying to close the gap and never let All Might run, catch his Special Action and betas using melee and gamma as Kendo can't do much far away, Assault All Might is overall pretty slow, so you shouldn't have much trouble.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is favorable to Kendo, literally same rule as fighting an Assault All Might, quite literally close the distanse and punish the All Might, everything he does you can punish him, including his gamma. One thing you gotta watch for in this match-up is to never let an All Might catch you by surprise, even then you do so mucb damage that All Might cannot do much to you. Never fight a Rapid All Might on a long range as Kendo can't do much to him far away and he can do alot to you, especially if you don't take cover when he's using alpha, as your shield might not be able to withstand it and break otherwise.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
This match-up is the equal opposite to All Might. He can punish everything you do, literally. Your best bet on this match-up is to punish his mistakes, such as trying to close the distance or missing his alphas or gamma. However remember he can punish everything you do. On this match-up you have two big advantages, these being your insane damage and an armored move (gamma), you can use that to close the distance, both of you have equal melees trying to do the same thing. This matchup can also be 🟢 very favorable to you depending on the player.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Both of you have insane damage, your best bet on this match-up is good usage of melees. This match-up is also very unfavorable to you because Mic's beta can counter your every move, not even your amored moves work on him, your best bet on this match-up is to jump a Mic before he jumps you.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Just never attempt to fight a good Cementoss without experience and rapid cards, as Cementoss does not care about anything you do as Kendo cannot do much. This match-up depends on usage of rapid cards and experience, however this is still very very unfavorable to you.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is one of the easiest for Assault Kendo as she outdamages him and she has better mobility than Strike Endeavor. Only thing you have to be mindful on this match-up is to be careful when fighting Endeavor inside rooms or buildings, always melee to stop him from using his Special Action on this match-up as you don't want Endeavor to get a high ground.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is a bit different compared to its Strike counterpart, here you have to be careful how you move and try not to let him beta you, with the insane run speed Kendo has this is also one of the easiest match-ups for her as things that apply in Strike Endeavor's match-up apply here aswell such as trying to not to let him Special Action his way above you, if you do end up getting hit by his beta use your own beta or gamma to get out of it or just stand in his beta blocking his upcoming gamma or alpha and it should be a okay.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This is also one of the easiest match-ups for Kendo as Hawks' most damaging move (beta) is a physical attack, and the rest of his kit can be blocked with your beta. On top of that with the help of good tuning you can also have better movement than he does, however only thing you have to be careful is to close your distance asap when you know he's low or when you knows he's gonna run away with this Special Action, in that case you should cancel his it with your melee.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Due to the fact that Strike Hawks beta has hyperarmor and his beta is a bit weird to block, his alpha being a AoE attack makes it an unfavorable attack, both you and Hawks can combo each other to death, this is a match-up which really depends on who punishes who on their mistakes.
<br>

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score (Small Form): 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Difficulty Score (Giant Form): 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
This match-up is one of the easiest for Kendo as she outdamages Mt Lady and you also have better mobilty, the only thing you have to be careful in this match-up is when Mt Lady goes Giant and is looking for you that's when the match-up becomes unfavorable, however small Mt Lady should not be too much of an issue, you can punish her beta with your combos and Mt Lady's gamma movement with your own movement.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
At level 9, fighting a Strike Shigaraki can be a little dangerous, however with proper positioning this match-up is not a issue at all as you outdamage Shigaraki, your beta can block the upcoming gamma. Fighting low level Shigaraki should not be an issue. It's recommended jumping a high lvl Shigaraki before he jumps on you in this match-up.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kendo literally does everything he does but better: combos, movement, damage..., you have everything he does but better, however when fighting upclose against an Assault Shigaraki you have to be careful of his upcoming gamma and his combos, as it can put you into a bad position or even kill you with his ToDs. After the combo, you can block everything he does with your beta too so that's a plus in this match-up.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you simply because of the fact that both of you are very grounded character and you can punish every mistake All For One does while also outdamaging him. One thing you gotta watch for in this match-up is to never get pulled in by his gamma, and try not to get hit by the beta as if All For One has a good second quirk this match-up can get very unfavorable, however he's very favorable if you just punish everything he does.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
It's Technical Dabi, he can't do much to you, just don't get into a building with a Dabi spamming his abilities constantly as he can outdamage you inside of one, that's the only rule.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This match-up is very favorable to you because you can block his only 2 moves he has, that is alpha and beta. Just do that and this matchup is very easy for Kendo. Even if he explodes it's okay for you as Lendo has a lot of HP.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This matchup is very easy to you because you can block everything Toga does, just dodge properly, as Toga was nerfed very hard, so there's not much to say just punish everything Toga does, you can punish her even if she tries to close the distance.
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is even to you because you have much more damage and am armored move, however on this match-up you must dodge the Toga's beta because if she lands that on you she gets a free gamma and alpha on you. The beta is literally the only move you gotta work around in this match-up, that's it. The rest depends on how good you are at closing the distance and dodging.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>

This match-up is favorable to you simply by the fact you can block everything Twice does and also the fact that after the nerfs he lost all his combos. This match-up depends on your blocking skill, even then this match is just dodging, blocking and punishing his attacks 'til you're close enough to take him down. Even if he tries to run away, he's kinda slow, even though he's a rapid.

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is even to you depending on you skill, however one thing to note is that your melee and gamma literally counters everything compress does, use that to your advantage and never let compress run away with gamma, as otherwise he will successfully run away.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Upclose you can do so much on this match-up and that's your only chance to win it. Generally speaking unless you can get upclose and guarantee kill there is almost no point fighting a Kurogiri far away, always fight a one upclose, but generally speaking Kurogiris play with good distance, everything you do he can do too, be it insane damage, insane combos..., your best bet on this match-up is fighting up close and not letting kurogiri get too far away from your initial place, however another mistake you gotta avoid is to never chase Kurogiri too hard, as Kendo doesn't have good mobility to compensate, and also the fact that your team may die if you go too far with no movement.
