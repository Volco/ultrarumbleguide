Itsuka Kendo is an assault character who excels at pumping damage and control. While she can hit hard, she isn’t a pure brawler who can recklessly push into every fight alone. Kendo thrives as a team-oriented fighter, using her shield, and punishes to create openings and protect her allies.
She is especially effective at punishing careless enemies who underestimate her due to her limited mobility. Assault Kendo has a lot of technical depth, with many mechanics and techs that reward players who master her full kit. However, because she lacks strong movement options, positioning is extremely important when playing Kendo - holding good ground is often the key to surviving and winning fights.

## Alpha Skill - Stone-throwing Fist

<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo’s Alpha skill is similar to the Alpha skills of beam-type characters such as Izuku Midoriya or Bakugo. It deals high damage at close range and its effectiveness varies with distance, depending on the opponent’s position. The skill has decent range and functions much like a shotgun blast.

It’s a straightforward ability — if your aim is solid, you’ll have little to worry about when using it. However, avoid using it like a typical beamer’s attack from long range against another beamer, as you’ll likely lose the trade.

Both the aimed and unaimed versions have the same effect; it simply comes down to whether or not you prefer to aim. There’s no functional difference between the two.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Beta skill is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast due to its strong punish potential. Using Beta, you can punish opponents who hit the shield because any physical attacks that lands on your shield they get stopped and staggered making it easier to land your gamma or melee chains, or use it to block incoming projectiles. How effectively you can block and punish depends on your experience and reaction time. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of when to use the shield and when to drop it.

Beta cannot always be used reactively, unlike its Strike counterpart. Keep in mind that you’re still vulnerable to attacks from behind, from the ground, and from wide-area effects. Enemies can also walk through the shield — if they do, they can hit you directly. You can punish these situations using your Melee, Alpha, or Gamma skills.

The punish options differ depending on the situation. For example, if an opponent hits your shield while in the air, you should almost always punish with Gamma, since most of your melee hits will miss. On the other hand, when punishing grounded opponents, you should ideally use melee attacks or short combos for the best results.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Big Fist Grip
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch046_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and deliver a powerful clap that deals solid damage. It has some of the best armor in the game and can be used to punish almost any opponent. However, be cautious when using it against players who understand how to fight Kendo — they can bait out your Beta or Gamma and punish you after dodging.

Your Gamma and melee attacks are your primary punishing tools, so try to use Gamma only when you’re confident the enemy won’t evade it. You can also use this skill to gain a bit of extra movement.
<p align="center">

</p>

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch046.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Special Action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great team ability, as it lets you throw your teammates across the map. For example, you can use it to reposition a character with limited mobility, such as Momo Yaoyorozu, or to help a low-HP teammate escape.

However, keep in mind that during your Special Action, you cannot attack. This leaves you vulnerable, so be aware of nearby enemies who can easily punish you while you’re stationary and unable to fight back.

You can also use this ability offensively — for instance, by throwing a teammate forward to quickly chase down an enemy. Once thrown, your teammate can immediately use their mobility skills to follow up. Technically, allies can still attack while being carried without dismounting, but this has limited utility and is mostly for fun. Certain attacks that root the user in place, such as Ibara’s moves, will cause the carried player to dismount.

Interestingly, a Hawks player can even carry a Kendo who’s carrying another teammate.

</p>


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo with a strong lunge when you're close to the opponent. This can be used as an alternative to Beta when Gamma is too slow against faster characters such as Iida, Rapid Deku, or Rapid All Might. You can also choose not to complete the full melee chain and instead interrupt it midway to mix in another skill, such as Alpha or Gamma. Be cautious when using melee attacks, as you’ll be vulnerable to other enemies while performing them. (See more in the combo section.)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4600m-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.

## Leveling Paths
### Hybrid Path: Alpha
A path for players who want to use their alpha. Ideally you also want Beta 4 for easier punished and Gamma 9 afterwards. The downside however is that your gamma will be low level so you need experience before you start leveling alpha first.

</p>

### Punish Path
For players that want to play Kendo as a punish character or if you don't feel like aiming. The only downside is that your alpha will be low level. This is the recommended path for newer Kendo players.

</p>

### Support Path
For players who want to play Kendo as a support. Level Beta to max level first, then you can branch into one the paths above.

</p>

## Techs
### Air Extension: Shield
If can cancel Kendo's beta skill midair with alpha, you will keep your aerial momentum, essentially letting you move faster. This works very well when it comes to chasing since you can attack at the same time you keep yourself fast.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Itsuka Kendo's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 25 DP (Per rock), 100 DP (Full Hit)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 500 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3-4: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP (Presumably 250)<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Alpha
A combo that takes advantage of melee's 400 total downpower to sneak in an extra alpha. This combo is only fully possible if the target is on HP before using alpha or against a corner, otherwise the alpha will either miss or do very little damage. Special tunes such as Acceleration make this combo work on GP.

</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Gamma

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Alpha -> Gamma

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
*To Be Filled*

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Since Kendo lacks a bit of mobility you can use wall runner to compensate the lack of mobility. It also removes the need of collecting various cards such as technical and rapid cards.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Kendo's melee is good, you can use embrittlement to amplify your damage. You can activate it using any sort of melees, pretty self explanatory. It also allows your teammates to deal more damage to the enemy you've struck.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>A solid option that makes Kendo speedy and makes it basically impossible to dodge her alphas.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Since Kendo does a lot of damage, you can use fixer to do even more damage with the right build and the right slots. If you can pair this with Embrittlement you've got yourself some absurd damage.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>A budget alternative to Wall Runner that works well for very specific builds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch105_00.png" width="125"> | **Trance Blow** <br>Trance blow can be used to slow enemies using your melee to do insane damage, however depending on character and chaos around you it can backfire.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Recommended tuning for somewhat experienced Kendos, more levels are always good, especially if you can KO people easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Recommended for experienced Kendos who can KO people easily, getting PU per KO always helps you get away from situations where you would not be able to otherwise.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_00.png" width="125"> | **Symbol of Peace** <br>Useful for extra survivability, especially in the early game.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>This tuning works with every character, as surviving lethal attacks with 1 HP is always useful. However, you gotta be wise with how you use your i-frames, Kendo's mobility is quite low, so this tune will only delay your death if you don't play wisely.
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>Since Kendo does absurd damage, revenge strike will always work with her. Getting a damage boost upon being guardbroken is nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support** <br>Heals you when guardbroken, this tuning is useful if you like using the Poison Mist to your advantage. This tuning is very specific and useful, recommended for newer Kendo players.|

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Deku’s reliance on his Alpha for damage is great news for Compress, as his Beta reflects it back for big damage on trigger happy opponents. If you hold your Beta out the most common counter will be to close distance and knock you out of it with his Beta, so watch for this response. His Gamma can be blocked, and if he uses it for movement, Compress can pretty easily catch up once he has both Gammas himself. His melee is unfortunately quite fast however, meaning he can easily break out of melee chains done on GP. Watch for the Beta and his Gamma grab combo, and this matchup favours Compress.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Unlike regular Deku, Compress struggles hard against Full Bullet. If he gets the jump on you he’ll be able to knock you down with his Alpha before you can put Beta up to reflect it. Your Beta also always reflects his Alpha as the unaimed version, meaning even when you do shoot it back it does very little damage. Once you’re knocked down and Full Bullet can attempt wake up catches is when the real struggle starts however, as Compress’s only real option in these disadvantageous scenarios is to use his i-frames to get distance and then Gamma away. To make matters worse, Full Bullet can catch your Gamma with the heel grab of his Beta, or if you take too long to teleport, can simply knock you over again with his Alpha and restart the cycle. If you can Gamma into the air while he's still falling with his Beta, you may be able to land some Alphas as he tries to recover.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Deku’s continued mastery of One For All is making him harder and harder to compete against when on Compress. While his grounded Alpha is easy to reflect thanks to its long wind-up, and his aerial Alpha is fairly easy to stop too, that's about where the positives end for Compress. OFA Deku is highly mobile and has great tools to get in and pressure you in close range. His melee armor will prevent you from stunning him yourself, so you really have no way to prevent him from going into Overdrive. Once in Overdrive his movement and close range expertise will become even more oppressive. In a one on one, the only opportunities you’ll have to punish OFA Deku is when he first activates either his Gamma, or his Special Action Fa Jin. If he activates his Special Action Smoke Screen prior to this however, it’ll be very hard to punish him with your Alphas stun. Alternatively, if you’re in a bigger fight look to wail on him while he’s performing melee’s on another player, as he’ll be stuck for a brief window finishing the animation. While you do have good movement to get away from this engagement, OFA Deku can do a decent job of catching up to you, or could even use the tracking on his Gamma to knock you out of the sky. If possible, it's best to try and use Gamma from behind cover to mitigate the chance he locks on to you.

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Bakugo is another character who heavily relies on his easily reflectable Alpha. However in this match-up you can also reflect the grenades that Bakugo throws as well, and even block the splash damage from grenades that hit the round. Bakugo can counter this by throwing grenades behind you to get past your Beta and hit your back, but otherwise half of his kit is almost completely countered here. He also lacks combos to make up for this, meaning he loses a lot of damage output in this fight. On top of this his mobility is quite poor compared to Compress, meaning chase or escape is easy too. As long as you dodge his incredibly telegraphed Gamma, this match-up is a breeze in most situations. 
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Once again the skillset is better against Compress. Machine Gun loves to get in close and move around fast with non-linear movement, both things Compress hates. He excels at getting in your face and making marbles hard to hit, and if he's too close and you can't direct hit him, your Alpha will fly past him. Your Beta’s reflection is much less useful here too as his sporadic movement means reflected Alphas likely won’t fully connect, and if he uses Beta over you it’ll hit you anyway. To fight this character you must often predict where he’s going to go in order to properly hit him, which isn't always easy, especially when he's going after you or has teammates close by. Try to get the jump on him first and force a chase so he’s using his abilities to run instead of fight back.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Your Beta is very important in this match up. Compress can block Ochaco’s Alpha, stopping damage and ruining her momentum if she’s airborne. Additionally, if she throws her Beta you can reflect it to stun her and potentially start your own combo. The obvious downside of this match up is if she hits her Gamma on you, it's a near death combo that forces you into a wake-up catch situation. It can also lift you up out of your own Gamma. If she picks you up with her Gamma, Beta as soon as possible to try and block her Beta and Alpha. If she goes for her Beta to try and wake up catch you, you may be able to reflect it if she throws immediately, stunning her and buying time to get away with your Gamma. Her movement with Zero Gravity, while typically better than Compress’, does leave her open while activating it, and without it she may struggle to run or catch up. 
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Reflect her Alphas when at range for high damage, and dodge it when she charges it up in close range engagements. Her Beta, while good mobility, is worse than Compress’ and is easy to track due to its size. Her Gamma is once again the biggest issue, as getting caught in it means taking a lot of damage. Just like rapid Ochaco, this Gamma can also catch your teleport if you aren't careful. Her mobility is okay, but its unlikely she'll be able to catch up to Compress anytime outside of the final circles. Lots of Zero Satellite players will try to use her charged Gamma to create a safe spot to heal, but this is very easy for Compress to counter thanks to his great verticality when using his Gamma. Teleporting up to rain Alphas on her works wonders here, and forces her to run away, delaying her healing once more. You can even claim her island for yourself if needed. 
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Iida is one of Compress’ worst match ups. He excels in getting in your face and staying there, delivering high damage combos if you make just one mistake. His incredible movement makes him a nightmare to hit, especially the directs you need to stun him. None of his moves can be reflected or blocked, and his Gamma makes running away or chasing him quite difficult. His Air Melee adds another element to his movement and makes him even harder to predict when in the air. To punish him, dodge either his Alpha or his Beta, spin around and try to stun him with your Alpha to start your own combo. If he has no GP and can’t be stunned, he becomes incredibly hard to punish unless he messes up very badly. Getting the jump on him is your best bet, as his low base health means you can deal a lot of damage when he doesn’t see you coming.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Another spammy character, Shoto loves shooting Alphas you can reflect. When a Shoto notices you start reflecting, the most common response is to use Gamma to try and freeze you so you can no longer fight back. Be ready to roll, and keep up the pressure with your own Alpha. Try your best to stay in a mid range when fighting Shoto, as getting close allows him to use his Beta on you for big damage or easily freeze you with Gamma. His mobility is much worse than Compress’ and you should be able to catch up or run easily. If he hides inside a building and blocks the door with his Beta, try to Gamma to another entrance to catch him off guard. If he uses Beta to create cover in the open, teleport over and rain Alphas on him or hold Beta to stop him from shooting you through the wall.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ice Fang is another good match-up for Compress, as long as you keep that nice midrange distance. Since his Alphas can freeze up close, and his Beta and Gamma both excel in that range, it's very important to not get too close. Just like with strike Shoto, reflecting his Alpha will likely trigger Ice Fang to go for his Beta spike. This is harder to dodge, so be especially careful here. The explosion after is more telegraphed fortunately, and not as hard to dodge, especially if you use your i-frames. The explosion can knock you out of your marble when using Gamma if you aren't careful. If you get Ice Fang low or start a shoot off, they’ll likely use Gamma to block your shots, which you can either teleport over, or absorb with your Beta to remove his cover. He has no mobility, so he can’t chase or escape easily.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Tsuyu’s main combo involves her getting close using her Alpha, and then going into Beta you. Blocking her Alpha will stop her momentum, and leave her open to a counter attack while she's stuck in the air. If she tries to Beta you dodge her aerial one by rolling to the side. The grounded Beta is a bit harder, but you’ll see most success rolling away from her rather than behind her, as the tongues hitbox will still reach back there if you mistime it. If she misses her ground Beta, she's left wide open, allowing for an easy punish. Her mobility lets her move similar distances to Compress, but while slightly more versatile in where she moves it's also slower, giving neither a clear advantage there. Watch for the extra movement granted by her air melee however, as it allows her to weave around you more easily in close quarters. If she's in your face, dodge her Betas, and then Gamma away.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Despite his terrible mobility, Kirishima actually doesn’t fare too badly against Compress in other departments. For starters none of his attacks can be reflected or blocked by Compress’ Beta, making the move useless in this fight. Additionally Kirishima is one of the kings of wake up catches, with his two most powerful moves knocking you down on hit and being great at catching you too. Compress hates being put in these kinds of situations as he has very limited options on what can be done on wake up. The worst part of this match up for Compress however is actually Kirishima's Special Action. Hardening completely removes the stun from Compress’ Alpha, one of his best tools, and also cuts the damage by a large amount. The only reason Compress doesn't lose this match up is purely because of Kirishima’s terrible movement. In areas with buildings/high ground, Compress' best option is to try and stay above Kiri and use his Alpha to scare him away, or force him to eat damage on his approach, before running and repeating over and over. If Kirishima had movement, he’d be an absolute nightmare for Compress.

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Compress’ greatest nightmare, Red Drive takes all the good things about Assault Kirishima and gives it movement. This is likely Compress’ worst match up. Everything said about Kirishima’s Special Action before is true once more, except now he is also much harder to hit. Red Drive’s Special Action basically makes him unpunishable in the Compress match up. Alongside that, his combo game and damage potential are insane, easily out performing Compress. It’s even harder to benefit from catching Red Drive off guard due to his much larger health pool, and Special Action meaning you may not even be stunning him when you do get the drop. The only redeeming factor of this match up is that Compress can reflect Red Drive’s Gamma, which is actually a very big deal here. Red Drive players love to spam this when you’re out of range or in the air, so this gives you an opportunity to deal high damage back from relative safety since you can easily be hit if you try to spam your Alpha while up high. It's best to try to stay above him using your Alpha in moderation and reflecting his Gamma when he tries to hit you back. While his movement is excellent, Compress can make ground initially when it comes to getting away. Even if he can catch up fairly well, it at least gives Compress a chance to run.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress can easily reflect Kaminari’s Alpha shots, and keep up with him due to his lesser mobility. His Beta will leave him stationary, so use this to your advantage if he ever misses it to deal huge damage to him. If you're ever caught inside, try and back up while spamming Alphas at him now that he can't move. The thing that evens out this match-up is just how high the damage is when Kaminari lands his Gamma on you. While telegraphed, it still comes out decently fast, and if you're hit you’ll take huge damage, or maybe even go down if the Kaminari is with a coordinated team. His Special Action also makes landing melee combos on him impossible without being countered, severely limiting your methods of damage outside of using your Alpha, or reflecting his.

Compress’ Beta will block his mines, as well as reflect or block his Alpha depending on how it's being fired. This counters the players who like to sit on high ground and snipe quite well. Additionally, Compress' fantastic vertical movement means he can easily confront these snipers too. Compress’ Gamma is once again all around better movement than Lightning’s Gamma. While Lightning’s Gamma can still electrify you, his lesser damage means getting hit isn’t nearly as game ending for you. That's not to say it isn't still threatening however, so do still be careful in close ranges where he can stun and gun you easily. Continue to be weary of his Special Action preventing your melee combos too.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
An excellent match up for Compress, he easily out performs Momo in most situations. Her lack of movement or consistent ranged damage is very noticeable here, as she essentially can't do anything to you in even a midrange engagement, and even less if you're above her. Her Beta, while it does block your shots, is very simple to dodge, and can also be teleported over to rain Alphas from above. If she uses it to run you can hit her from behind or Gamma to catch up. Her Gamma isn’t great outside, and is also a non-factor in most head to head fights. The cannonballs can also be reflected by your Beta if needed, and its splash damage can be blocked. Her Alpha is the only good thing for her as it easily knocks down and allows for wake up catching with her Gamma. It can be reflected however, so predict when she uses it and you’ll stun her to start your own combo. The only place she can turn tides is inside where her close range expertise can excel, especially her cannons. For the most part, just don’t follow her inside because that's where she wants to be.

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
While this match up is often decided by what quirks Monoma is currently in possession of, he does have something else he can take advantage of. Obviously his Special Action refreshing is what beings referred to here, essentially giving him unlimited movement with his Beta and stolen quirks. In early to midgame, Monoma is nearly impossible to catch up to thanks to his refresh unless he gets very cocky and doesn’t get far enough away. If his Special Action depletes or he doesn't go far enough, Compress’ double Gamma is good movement against him. If he’s able to copy your Gamma it makes his mobility even scarier. His refresh also allows Monoma to constantly spam a variety of other moves, many of which Compress could possibly struggle with. In terms of his base kit his Alpha does so little damage it's often not worth reflecting if he has your Alpha already, and instead you should mostly just trade Alphas since yours does so much more damage. His beta is the biggest issue just because it's a fast melee attack, but it fortunately isn't too threatening. If he enters his Gamma try not to hit him so he doesn't get given yours, unless he starts healing, in which case you may want to consider stopping him. When it comes to Monoma's who air stall, Compress does actually do quite well against them. Your double Gamma allows you to get incredibly high in the air, and even if he’s still above you your Alphas range can still allow you to hit him. Grab a teammate with your Special Action and bring them up there too to try and force him down even faster.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kendo’s shield is a huge problem for Compress in a fight. Its huge size and high health means in a one on one situation, there's really no way to hit Kendo until you can wear down her shields health. To make matters worse, if the item from Compress’ Alpha isn't released before hitting the shield, it will only take the 5 damage the marble hits for instead of the much larger damage done by the item and shockwave. Kendo is another character who loves wake up catching too, and her Gamma is excellent for this. Her Alpha also does big damage while in close range, and while you can reflect it for big damage back she may bait you into this before hitting you with Gamma. Her melee combo game is also very good, and much better than Compress’, so be careful there too. Try to just keep her at a distance to whittle down her shield and run with your Gamma if she gets close. Fortunately she doesn't have the movement to chase or run from Compress, so without her shield she’s a sitting duck.

Unfortunately Kendo has been given movement to chase and run from Compress, turning an already bad match up into a terrible one. While Compress’ double Gamma is still better overall for distance, Twin Palm’s Gamma into air melee movement is incredible and she can definitely still catch up if you aren’t careful, especially early game or in smaller final circles. Her Alpha will stun you too (even through Gammas armor) and although you can reflect it to stun her and use Gamma to get away or start your own combo, you're bound to take high damage if you’re hit. Her Beta allows her to soak up damage while increasing its power, and like Kirishima prevents your Alpha from stunning her, nullifying Compress’ greatest strength. All of her moves can easily force wake up catches too. If she tries to catch you with a charged Alpha or while you're in the air, hold Beta and force her to miss her Alpha or take the reflected hit so you can Gamma. If she keeps holding it, move to cover or break line of sight to try getting away with Gamma. If she doesn't charge the Alpha she could pretty much try anything, so it's best to just try and dodge what she chooses. Trying to reflect an uncharged Alpha is not worth taking a Beta or Gamma if you predict wrong.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara can be a very scary fight when on Compress. With her Alpha she has huge range and even bigger damage, putting Compress at the disadvantage as he can’t block it with his Beta and it knocks him down. Her Beta, especially at higher levels, is great at both knocking you down and catching your wake up if you aren't careful. Her Gamma does insane damage directly to your HP, and like all grabs can hit you through your Gamma’s armor and stop it going off. Her close range expertise means you rarely want to try and melee her, especially since she has armor on all of her moves. All of her moves do leave her as a stationary target on a whiff, so make sure to capitalize on that to return big damage or get distance from her if you're in her Beta/Gamma range. The sky and tall buildings are unsurprisingly your best bet in this fight, as she's limited to using only her Alpha and being an easy target to hit if she misses while you look down on her. If you're in the air and she hits you however, you become a lot easier to hit again as your recovery takes away a lot of your momentum, making you a slow moving target in the open air. Make sure to utilize your i-frames so you aren't an easy target for a second hit.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While Mirio is prone to exploding if you can catch him off guard, his movement and love for close up encounters can sometimes put Compress at the disadvantage. He loves close quarters fights, and his movement is also superb, being one of very few characters who can outright get away from Compress. His Gamma being able to block your projectiles and force you in close can be good to bait you into an uncomfortable position. What helps Compress the most in this match up is Mirio’s low health pool, and easily exploitable punish windows upon an Alpha or Beta whiff. These leave Mirio stationary and if you're fast enough to hit him can lead to him taking big damage. If you aren't quick enough however, he can reset the situation if he enters his Special Action for invincibility to wait out his cooldowns. In his Special Action he can also just run up to you directly without threat to force close range fights. In this situation it's best to either run yourself, or use Gamma to get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Fitting his namesake, Sheer Counter is an excellent counter to just about everything Compress wants to do. For starters his Alpha makes him invincible, meaning not only can you not hit him with your own Alphas, but reflected Alphas don’t hit him back either unless he stands still. This is terrible for Compress, as your main method of damage is completely stopped here, and you can’t stun him either. His counter is also a fantastic move against Compress. Since your offensive gameplan pretty much boils down to spam Alpha, it's very easy for Sheer Counter to predict this and time his Gamma accordingly. Your Alphas huge size and the shockwave after make it especially easy for him to counter you. While his movement isn’t superb compared to Compress’, he actually has a way to counter your Gamma too. By timing his Gamma alongside yours, hitting him with the smoke bomb you drop will send him straight after you to easily knock you back down. You must play cautiously around Sheer Counter, baiting his counter so you can punish him on a whiff or run away. His Beta can be similarly punished if he misses, and fortunately isn’t too strong of a move. His Special Action is still a problem letting him engage you for free, except you now have to be careful about timing his counter if you try and Gamma away from him while he’s in it.

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Although his Alpha is blocked by your Beta, the grab version of it can still be quite scary as a hit means you’re likely to be losing a large chunk of your health. That being said, a whiff or hit into your Beta often lets you squeeze an Alpha hit back at him while he recovers, giving you the sustainability to win the fight. His Beta is a bit trickier, as its tracking and movement speed can sometimes make it a bit awkward to dodge. On hit it also gives him invisibility, so make sure you keep track of him if he knocks you down. Learning the dodge window for this move makes it much more bearable since it's his best option against Compress. His Gamma is fortunately not a huge problem for Compress. While it will always be annoying as a third party tool, in a direct fight Compress can just block it with his Beta. If you catch a Tamaki using it with their back turned or if they miss, they’re a sitting duck and you can often deal huge damage or even downright knock them if they don’t cancel it fast enough.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Easily one of Compress’ best match ups, Nejire is one of only three characters whose entire moveset can be stopped by Compress’ Beta. Her Alpha is nothing special, being overall worse than Compress’ and reflectable using your Beta. Her Beta can be blocked with yours, and while it is good for knocking you down she sort of struggles to catch Compress’ wake up thanks to everything being blockable. You can allow her to waste her Betas charge firing into your own Beta, and then Alpha her back when she gives up. If she isn't looking at you her Beta leaves her a mostly stationary target to wail on. Her Gamma can give her height making her harder to hit, but once more can be reflected, although it rarely actually hits her back. Her movement is all around worse than Compress’ and while her floating can make it more difficult to hit her, it isn't that hard if you can get used to it. Even if you can’t just wait for her to come down since she can’t do anything to you up there anyway.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While his Alpha can be blocked, often allowing you to slip in an Alpha while he recovers, his sheer damage potential and team combo potential still make this match up quite hard. Shinso is another character who thrives in catching your wake up with his Gamma and Beta. Teleporting into the air while he falls with his Beta is a great way to both take loads of damage and get knocked out of your marble, wasting a charge. This combined with the fact that the brief animation before you teleport leaves you wide open to being hit by his Gamma, Alpha, or even his Special Action, means your best wake up option is incredibly risky if you can't find a safe spot to use it. His Gamma allows him to land all his moves much easier if it connects, and it can even be mixed into combos for a guaranteed hit to make running even harder. On a miss however, he does leave himself quite open while he recovers which will allow you to spam Alphas in return. This also applies to his Special Action. His movement is also quite good, and while he may not have the distance to fully get away, he can certainly move around in ways that will make him awkward to both track down or finish off.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While All Might’s Alpha can be reflected like most others, you may be surprised to learn you can even block the splash damage from it with your Beta as well. All Might's Beta will be his best tool against you on Compress, as if you don’t recover quick enough after being hit, it can be combo’d into a second Beta or into a ton of Alphas. For this reason if you're hit by it, recover as fast as possible, but let your i-frames run out so you can’t be hit by any subsequent moves, especially that second Beta. If you start reflecting Alphas, this is most likely the move he’ll use in response, so get ready to dodge it. All Might's Gamma isn't too strong, and is mostly used as a way to stall since you can’t hit him while he’s in it. Typically All Might players will use his Special Action leap after exiting this to run, so be ready to quickly wail on him with Alphas while he crouches and then keep chase with your Gamma. This should fortunately be quite easy, as although All Might has decent movement Compress’ is still superior. If he chooses to use his Betas to get more distance it also means his best move in this fight will be gone, so keep track of how many charges he uses when moving around.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatlings Alpha is just about one of the easiest Beta reflection targets in the entire game. Its long start up before it starts dealing big damage will give you ample time to begin reflecting it with your Beta. If he tries to use his uncharged Beta, you can also reflect that to stun him and start potential Combos. Holding your Beta out will likely bait him into going for one of his two most dangerous moves in this match up, his charged Beta, or his Gamma. His Gamma is especially damaging, and can grab you out of your own Gamma, so be on the lookout for it. If he misses his Gamma his recovery is quite punishable, allowing you to spam your Alpha against him. Although Gatlings movement is a little better than default All Might’s, escape or chase still shouldn’t be a primary concern for Compress here.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
While Aizawa’s Alpha can be blocked by your Beta, often allowing you to squeeze an Alpha in between his attempts to grab you, his damage potential and reliable counter to your whole kit easily gives Aizawa the upper hand. When you throw your Alpha in between his attempts to grab you really have to try and aim for a stun or else he can spam his own Alpha to try and start his high damage combos. Aizawa can also easily close distance and dart around you using his aerial Alpha and Beta, making him very hard to hit. Aizawas Gamma is a hard move to fight when on Compress, as its ability to block all shots from his front and sides means you’ll have to be behind him to get a hit on him. If you're able to get the opportunity to attack his exposed behind however he’ll be stuck losing a lot of health. Aizawa's Special Action is unsurprisingly a huge counter against Compress, as not only does it allow for an easy attempt of his grounded Alpha with you not being able to block or fight back, but if you’re in your Gamma’s marble and become affected by it, you’ll be kicked out which ruins your momentum. Finding a good moment to use your Gamma in this fight can already be hard as well, as the pause before your teleport sets him up for an easy grab if you aren't careful. Aizawa's movement is nothing to scoff at either, being able to make good ground regardless if he's running from or chasing you.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Like when fighting most Alpha spam characters, an easy get around to a trigger happy Mic will be to reflect his Alpha with your Beta. This is especially important to do in this match up, as thanks to his Special Action Present Mics Alpha can easily stack up damage even faster than normal. Mic does have some counterplay here, as throwing his radio behind you will let it hit you since your back is turned to it. In close quarters Present Mic players will often go for his easy tap Beta into Gamma combo. If he starts with Beta you can actually block this and attempt to dodge his Gamma after or start stunning him if you're quick. Be careful if he expects this though, as if he does just Gamma he’ll punch you straight through your barrier. If you ever dodge his Gamma, its end lag gives you a good punish opportunity, or gives you time to Gamma away if you're in a bad spot. Just like his tap Beta, you can also block his charged Beta, which shouldn’t be too difficult as its long start up gives ample time for you to put up your Beta. In the event he does knock you down, watch for his tap Beta, as its stun will stop you from teleporting on wake up. In terms of movement, Mic is very outclassed against Compress, and you shouldn’t struggle to run or catch up to him.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Despite his unique playstyle Cementoss will normally be a good match up for Compress. Both his Alpha and Gamma can be reflected while still in midair, meaning his combo game against Compress is much more limited as it relies on the stun from direct hits for max damage. If you're hit by Alpha or Gamma, recover/roll as fast as possible to try and prevent a follow up attack. Cementoss is great at creating his artificial high ground for both vertical movement and to create a safe spot to heal. Compress’ Gamma is an excellent counter to this however, as it can easily get you above Cementoss to rain Alphas on him. Watch for if he places a Gamma on top however, as it’ll block you from getting above him if you’re too close to the pillar. If he doesn't stack his pillars high enough  you actually won’t need Gamma at all, as simply throwing Alphas from the ground can still let you hit him thanks to the marble's arc and the projectile size. While this primarily covers the counter play outside, fighting Cementoss inside is not advised unless you already have a considerable advantage. His ability to block your exits combined with the fact his moves are super easy to hit inside, will put you at a big disadvantage.

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor struggles quite a bit in this match up. His Alpha, while capable of high damage if you aren't careful, is very easy to block and you can react to it after he gets a tick or two worth of hits. His Beta will be his most threatening move thanks to its very high damage, so reflecting it is instrumental in stopping Endeavor's offense. It does offer counterplay against your Beta though, as once it lands on a surface the pillar it makes can’t be blocked anymore. His Gamma is also not blockable. If he misses it or you catch an Endeavor using it against someone else however, him being stuck in the air gives you an excellent opportunity to spam Alphas into him. In the event he knocks you down, try to find cover before using Gamma to get away. Otherwise the pause before the teleport makes you an easy Beta target. The movement granted by Endeavor’s Special Action is far outclassed by Compress’ Gamma.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Much like with Strike Endeavor, Inferno Fist’s Beta is the move you’ll want to watch for. Its spawn AOE and ability to drag you back inside can make for a lethal trap, so it's best to just Gamma out in most situations. If Inferno Fist tries to melt you with Alphas while you're stuck, reflect them with your Beta until he stops before you use Gamma to discourage him from following. If he tries to use his Gamma, teleport instantly to avoid it. In the event you don’t have Gamma available, you can reflect his Gamma too, but only while it's airborne. Once it hits the ground you’ll need to run. If you're ever in the open holding your Beta against him, be aware you’re an easy target for his Beta and that you’ll need to watch for it. His movement is the same as his base, so still not great.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Hawks only really has one good move in this match up and that is his Beta. Its near guaranteed shield break and being a super easy method to knock you down already make it great. The additional movement on hit it provides him is the cherry on top though, as Hawks become much harder to hit with his increased speed and can easily follow up on you. If he misses his first Beta it is easy to punish however. His slow moving auto-track Alpha sucks, and will do very little damage before you can react and block it. A Hawks who can quickly beam with the aimed version before moving again is much harder to react to. His Gamma is easy to dodge and reflectable too, so make sure to attempt the reflect whenever you see him do his spin. Even with his nerfs his movement is nothing to scoff at, and if you get outlined by his Gamma you may have difficulty running away.

Much like the base Battle Style for Hawks, Slicing Wind only really has one truly problematic move for Compress in his Gamma. Its combo potential, and large hitbox make it very dangerous if you can’t avoid it. Try and recover as quickly as possible to prevent follow ups if you're hit by this attack. Like most Alpha’s, Slicing Wind is reflected right back at him, so watch for him so you can return to sender. His Beta is sort of an awkward move to characterize. While it is damaging if he lands it, it can be dodged fairly easily and leaves him very open to punish if he misses. Its best use against Compress will be to use it to break out of combos, as at level 7 it can break through the effects of stuns, countering Compress’ Alpha. His movement is quite good too, so it may be difficult to run from or catch up to Slicing Wind if he has his cooldowns.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Mt. Lady is an excellent close range fighter, and ideally someone you want to interact with from a nice middleground. This highly limits her damage options and forces her to make a play to try and get in which you can predict, or spam her Alpha which you can reflect. Highground is ideal though as it's much harder for her to reach and she wastes moves to get up. If Mt Lady ever gets too close to you, you should try and Gamma away since that's where she excels. Do be careful though, as her stomps can stun you out of it. If she ever knocks you down her Beta will be her best wake up catch option, so avoid that as best as possible. Her movement is quite poor, so you’ll outclass her there. Her giant form isn’t particularly bad unless you're right beside her making you an easy target. Her Alpha is incredibly easy to reflect thanks to its slow speed, and her Beta is easily dodged by teleporting into the air. Her Gamma will be the only real threat as its huge hitbox means you aren't safe in the sky. If she ever enters this mode, try your best to disengage as fast as possible, as her huge damage reduction and insane damage make winning a fight almost impossible if she's even kind of healthy.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Unfortunately for Shigiraki he really struggles to do much to Compress. His Alpha and Beta being grounded when Compress can easily fly into the air or get high ground with his Gamma means he lacks the ability to deal consistent damage to you. His Alpha also leaves him open to a counter attack since he's stationary using it. Even when you don’t have Gamma available, jumping over and over to stay off the ground until you get it back will negate some damage. You do need to keep in mind his Alpha and Beta can travel up surfaces though, so you aren't entirely safe when you are on top of buildings. If Shigiraki tries to Gamma you, dodge towards him so he runs right past you. It’ll grab you through your Gamma’s armor so using it won’t be a safe option to get away. If he does land it recover as fast as possible or else he may be able to hit his Special Action after to inflict Defense Down on you. His Gamma and Special Action being his movement sources means you won’t struggle to run or catch up to him. Shigi really isn't scary unless you’re in a small final circle or inside a building with him. Try and avoid those situations and he shouldn't be an issue.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Catastrophe is another character utilizing stuns like Compress. While you can reflect both his Alpha and Beta, he can easily get around this by throwing them at the ground instead to damage you. This means you’ll have to be smart using it, as just holding it out will invite unwanted damage while you do nothing back to him. If he's close to you Catastrophe can also go for his Gamma instead, allowing him to start his combos. If you’re ever hit by one of these combos you’ll also be taking a ton of damage which’ll force you to flee. Fortunately he isn’t too good at catching your wake up or stopping your Gamma. The best thing to try and do in this match up is just get the stun on him first if you're close, or stay above him and rain down your Alpha. Fortunately your Gamma is great movement against Catastrophe, so he can’t outrun or chase you well.

When it comes to AFO’s base kit you’ll be having quite a back and forth match up. Like all Alphas if AFO spams it against you it’ll be very easy to reflect it back. You can reflect the charged version too, and thanks to its slow movement speed you can actually walk into its path on missed shots to ensure it's reflected. His Beta will be his counter to you, as it's quite large and can’t be reflected or blocked. Its ability to go through walls also gives AFO an option to stop you from following him in or out of buildings. His Gamma is a very back and forth move here. Dodging this move leaves AFO wide open to a counter attack or it’ll allow you an opportunity to escape him. Its lack of Armor also means you can stun him out of it if you're close enough. Mistiming a dodge however gives AFO a free combo which is almost guaranteed to do huge damage. This move also can’t be dodged while you’re in the air, which is a problem for Compress since he’s in it so often thanks to his Gamma. When approaching AFO or using Gamma in an area you know one is in, try when possible to make sure he’s already used his Gamma so you won’t be caught in it while airborne. His base kit doesn't have any movement. AFO’s stolen quirks will offer an additional challenge to you depending on what he has in the pocket. Any quirks that provide him movement will be what you want to watch for, as a 400HP character with the potential to run or catch up to you can make for a scary fight. His reliance on the stolen quirks levels needing to be high does help you though.

Dabi is another character who really just can’t touch Compress outside of close range. Engage Dabi from a mid range or from above and he shouldn’t be an issue. Although his Alpha tracks you, its slow speed makes it very easy to dodge, and even easier to reflect. His Beta only deals damage when you run over it, so watch for where he places it in a fight. Your Alpha is great at setting them off from range, as the large projectile size and shockwave can both set them off. Dabi’s Beta can also eat projectiles to protect himself. Unfortunately for Dabi, this only includes the marble portion of your Alpha since the object persists until it touches the ground. While the object will fly past if he remains inside the trap's radius, if he continues to run he might get hit anyway. If you chase Dabi into a building his traps will be a much bigger problem in the enclosed space. He can also use them to block exits to stop you fleeing. His Gamma is his best tool against Compress thanks to it actually fully blocking your Alpha. If you're outside, simply Gamma over it to rain Alphas from above. If Gamma is unavailable he still can’t do much to you since as long as you're outside the radius, his Alpha is his only option to hit you. Inside buildings his Gamma is much better since you can’t teleport over it, and it can go through walls to hit you on the other side. He doesn’t have movement to run or chase.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Crazy Torch’s simple game plan of run up and Beta you can work both great and poorly against Compress. On one hand he becomes very easy to predict, often running at you in a straight line and inviting you to stun them with Alpha. You can even stun him out of his Beta before he hits you. Getting stunned like this while also draining their own HP if their Gamma is active puts Crazy Torch in a very bad spot. If he can hit you though, Compress can really struggle since the grab knocks you down on hit. Compress hates these wake up catch scenarios, and Crazy Torch is great at them thanks to his Betas tracking. If you try and Gamma  he can just Beta you again to either DOWN you or get you very low. It's very important to keep track of how many Beta’s Crazy Torch has (max 2), because if you’re alive after the second one is used you know he can’t catch you anymore and you can Gamma away. His Gamma is another good counter to you though, as the small fire shockwaves it produces will block your Alpha from hitting him, and also all but guarantee you won’t be able to finish a combo on him thanks to it knocking you away if you're going for a melee. His alpha isn't very problematic for you, and his Beta being his movement means his best offense is wasted if he uses it to run.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Togas Beta will be her best move in this fight. Its quick movement speed and ability to knock you down even through your Gamma’s armor can make it difficult to counter. You can stun her out of this move however, so if you dodge it try and either punish her with Alphas or Gamma to distance yourself. Her Alpha has a shockingly long range for what it is, so you're not safe just because you’re out of her Beta distance. It can also stack damage fast if you aren’t careful, so make sure to reflect it when possible. Toga’s Gamma can be blocked by your Beta, so always try and stop it when it comes out. If you don't, she'll be able to either refresh cancel her abilities similar to Monoma, or can chase or run using your own mobility. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Sting Dance is another hard to hit aerial character that Compress struggles with. Thanks to her fantastic air mobility, Sting dance is often darting around above you and not giving many opportunities to counter attack her until she's back on the ground. While her Alpha is reflectable and her Gamma can be blocked, her Beta can bypass it and stun you, allowing for an easy Gamma follow up from her. You especially don’t want Sting Dance to start cooldown refreshing as normally her moves won’t start reloading until she's touched the ground. Giving her the option to reset in the air is not good. While she's in the air it's best to just try and dodge her until she makes a mistake or runs out of moves and is forced to land. If she misses a Gamma for example, she's slow to recover, which gives you the chance to try and stun her. You can also get into the air yourself using Gamma, which will prevent her Beta from hitting you since it only hits below her. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
The match up against Mr. Compress is not kind to Twice at all. For starters he’s the second of three characters who can have all of their moves stopped by Compress’ Beta. Simply holding out your Beta to Twice almost completely stops him. His only real option is to try and melee you, which isn't a terrible option thanks to the slide making it hit from an unexpected distance. Learn to expect this and dodge it, and Twice is incredibly punishable on a miss. The only other way for him to get around this is to hope a clone of a player he previously downed counters Compress. His alpha is reflectable, his Beta is (somehow) blockable and its low health means its Alpha spam will kill itself. His Gamma is blockable, and is also pretty poor for movement. Just wait for a mistake, and Twice can virtually never win this fight.

Due to the threat of each Compress’ Alpha stun, a lot of this match up can be spent with both parties trying to predict when the other will drop their Beta. In this situation it’s often best to be the aggressor. Close distance on your mirror match but in a diagonal line so you’re harder to hit, and throw some jumps in there as well. If your opponent sees you approaching they’ll likely take down their Beta to try and stop you, so try and predict this with an occasional Alpha. Approaching this way will ensure even reflected Alphas don’t hit you back most of the time. If you predict right you can start your own Alpha combo. Some Compress players are very scared of opposing Alphas, and may not drop their Beta at all. In these situations the occasional Alpha will keep them too scared to lower it, while you close the final distance to start potential melee combos. In an Alpha spam fight, you may be tempted to Gamma into the air and rain them from above. You should always try and be the second Compress to do this though. Assuming your opponent Gammas into the air, Gamma up after them immediately. This prevents them from hitting you while they’re above, and lets you catch up. If they choose to go higher with their second Gamma, go up after them again. This leaves you as the Compress with the high ground as your opponent is stuck falling below you, and they can only try and Beta to save themselves. If you went up first, they could do this to you. Because your movement is the same, the previous idea also applies here. If you're the first to Gamma away, the other Compress can always catch you, so try and force the other to run first. For the most part just always try and use Gamma second.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Overhaul is another fairly grounded character who can struggle against Compress, but will fare a bit better. Staying on top of high ground or in the air above him will be your best bet, since he is actually quite strong on the ground. His counter to you sitting on high ground will be his Beta, as he can make it hit the edge of the buildings you’ll be looking down from. His Gamma will be his scariest move, as it stops you from using your own Gamma, and can combo into itself or any of his other moves. It's also very good for catching your wake up if he ever knocks you down. His Special Action will prevent you from landing any melee combos on him, and he can also heal up for free using it, essentially giving him 2 health bars for you to take down. While Overhaul isn’t very scary early on, in small finals circles or inside tight buildings, he poses a very big threat if you can’t stay above him consistently.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kurogiri is the final character who is completely stopped by your Beta. Against your Beta his Alpha will be reflected, and his Beta will be blocked. This means just like Twice you can more or less just wait for him to make a mistake to punish him. Kurogiri is another one of the characters who can just outrun Compress if he’s put on the back foot however, as his portals go crazy distances you just can’t keep up with. Additionally, if a Kurogiri is able to hit you with his Beta, locking you into something like his quad Beta combo does absolutely ridiculous damage and will immediately put you at a major disadvantage. Even some of his other combos can be quite threatening. If he ever sends his Gamma ball after you keep in mind his Alphas will be blocked rather than reflected. This means you will have to shoot it down, which fortunately isn't too hard with your Alphas massive size. If Kurogiri is trying to air stall in his Gamma, Gamma up after him and hit him while he's stuck up there to try and force him down.
