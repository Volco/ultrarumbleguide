Itsuka Kendo is an assault character who excels at pumping damage and control. While she can hit hard, she isn’t a pure brawler who can recklessly push into every fight alone. Kendo thrives as a team-oriented fighter, using her shield, and punishes to create openings and protect her allies.
She is especially effective at punishing careless enemies who underestimate her due to her limited mobility. Assault Kendo has a lot of technical depth, with many mechanics and techs that reward players who master her full kit. However, because she lacks strong movement options, positioning is extremely important when playing Kendo - holding good ground is often the key to surviving and winning fights.

## Alpha Skill - Stone-throwing Fist

<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo’s Alpha skill is similar to the Alpha skills of beam-type characters such as Izuku Midoriya or Bakugo. It deals high damage at close range and its effectiveness varies with distance, depending on the opponent’s position. The skill has decent range and functions much like a shotgun blast.

It’s a straightforward ability — if your aim is solid, you’ll have little to worry about when using it. However, avoid using it like a typical beamer’s attack from long range against another beamer, as you’ll likely lose the trade.

Both the aimed and unaimed versions have the same effect; it simply comes down to whether or not you prefer to aim. There’s no functional difference between the two.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand
<p align="center">

</p>

Kendo’s Beta skill is what sets her apart from the rest of the cast due to its strong punish potential. Using Beta, you can punish opponents who hit the shield because any physical attacks that lands on your shield they get stopped and staggered making it easier to land your gamma or melee chains, or use it to block incoming projectiles. How effectively you can block and punish depends on your experience and reaction time. Over time, you’ll develop a sense of when to use the shield and when to drop it.

Beta cannot always be used reactively, unlike its Strike counterpart. Keep in mind that you’re still vulnerable to attacks from behind, from the ground, and from wide-area effects. Enemies can also walk through the shield — if they do, they can hit you directly. You can punish these situations using your Melee, Alpha, or Gamma skills.

The punish options differ depending on the situation. For example, if an opponent hits your shield while in the air, you should almost always punish with Gamma, since most of your melee hits will miss. On the other hand, when punishing grounded opponents, you should ideally use melee attacks or short combos for the best results.

## Gamma Skill - Big Fist Grip

</p>

Kendo’s Gamma skill allows her to lunge forward and deliver a powerful clap that deals solid damage. It has some of the best armor in the game and can be used to punish almost any opponent. However, be cautious when using it against players who understand how to fight Kendo — they can bait out your Beta or Gamma and punish you after dodging.

Your Gamma and melee attacks are your primary punishing tools, so try to use Gamma only when you’re confident the enemy won’t evade it. You can also use this skill to gain a bit of extra movement.

## Special Action - Big Fist Carry
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch046.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Kendo’s Special Action allows her to carry an ally with her enlarged hand. This is a great team ability, as it lets you throw your teammates across the map. For example, you can use it to reposition a character with limited mobility, such as Momo Yaoyorozu, or to help a low-HP teammate escape.

However, keep in mind that during your Special Action, you cannot attack. This leaves you vulnerable, so be aware of nearby enemies who can easily punish you while you’re stationary and unable to fight back.

You can also use this ability offensively — for instance, by throwing a teammate forward to quickly chase down an enemy. Once thrown, your teammate can immediately use their mobility skills to follow up. Technically, allies can still attack while being carried without dismounting, but this has limited utility and is mostly for fun. Certain attacks that root the user in place, such as Ibara’s moves, will cause the carried player to dismount.

Interestingly, a Hawks player can even carry a Kendo who’s carrying another teammate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-string combo with a strong lunge when you're close to the opponent. This can be used as an alternative to Beta when Gamma is too slow against faster characters such as Iida, Rapid Deku, or Rapid All Might. You can also choose not to complete the full melee chain and instead interrupt it midway to mix in another skill, such as Alpha or Gamma. Be cautious when using melee attacks, as you’ll be vulnerable to other enemies while performing them. (See more in the combo section.)

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Kendo jumps and lunges forward enlarging her hand for a big hit. You can land two air melees before the knockback for a combo with any of your skill depending on where you are. You can mix your combos between melees and skills, more onto that in the combo section.

## Leveling Paths
### Hybrid Path: Alpha
A path for players who want to use their alpha. Ideally you also want Beta 4 for easier punished and Gamma 9 afterwards. The downside however is that your gamma will be low level so you need experience before you start leveling alpha first.

</p>

### Punish Path
For players that want to play Kendo as a punish character or if you don't feel like aiming. The only downside is that your alpha will be low level. This is the recommended path for newer Kendo players.

### Support Path
For players who want to play Kendo as a support. Level Beta to max level first, then you can branch into one the paths above.

## Techs
### Air Extension: Shield
If can cancel Kendo's beta skill midair with alpha, you will keep your aerial momentum, essentially letting you move faster. This works very well when it comes to chasing since you can attack at the same time you keep yourself fast.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Itsuka Kendo's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 25 DP (Per rock), 100 DP (Full Hit)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 500 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3-4: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP (Presumably 250)<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3 -> Melee 4 -> Alpha
A combo that takes advantage of melee's 400 total downpower to sneak in an extra alpha. This combo is only fully possible if the target is on HP before using alpha or against a corner, otherwise the alpha will either miss or do very little damage. Special tunes such as Acceleration make this combo work on GP.

</p>

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Gamma
A combo that makes use of her air melee to keep the enemy locked midair and finish with a gamma. Only works on HP.
