# <a style="color: rgba(255,245,138,255) !important;">Special T.U.N.I.N.G. Info and Resources</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about the effects of Special T.U.N.I.N.G. skills, as well as useful resources to truly know in detail the extent of some Special Tunes, extra info and visual examples!

# Strike Special Tunes

## Kota Finder
Kota Finder lets the player see Kota's location on the minimap by placing an icon with his head in his location. Technically you can also see him through walls, but this only works well if you're really close, in which case you will be able to see his silouhette colored yellow or red depending on the device you're playing on.

It's recommended that players using Kota Finder play a high-mobility character so that they can quickly reach Kota's location. Because Kota is hard to see from far distances, it's recommended that players press M to open the minimap and place a ping in Kota's location so that you can see his position while moving towards him, and also to let your teammates know. It's also recommended to either pick the middle of the map or a spot that is close to the majority of Kota's spawn locations. Kota Finder should also preferrably be on the right Special Tuning slot rather than the left, as at max level you will know his location as soon as the countdown hits zero and the match starts, while at Level 10 you will have to wait 8 seconds. It surprisingly not that bad at low level if you're playing in lower ranks, as people there often don't run Kota Finder.

Kota Finder is a risky special tuning skill, since even though rescuing Kota gives you a huge advantage, you will only get value out of it if you're successful rescuing Kota. If another team gets him before you, you will be sitting with a useless tuning for the rest of the match. For that reason, people might prefer Divine Protection, which is more versatile and can get you more value than Kota Finder, just a bit later. Pay attention to Present Mic (the announcer) for mentions of Kota (even if you play with Japanese Audio), as that will indicate that an enemy team already claimed him. Some people equip Speedy Civilian Rescue to rescue Kota as fast as possible, however whether or not this is a good strat is up for debate.

</p>


Leveling Kota Finder reduces the time it takes for it to activate, the higher the level, the sooner it will activate.
- Level 1: 1 Minute
- Level 2: 56 seconds
- Level 3: 52 seconds
- Level 4: 48 seconds
- Level 5: 44 seconds
- Level 6: 24 seconds
- Level 7: 20 seconds
- Level 8: 16 seconds
- Level 9: 12 seconds
- Level 10: 8 seconds
- Level 11: Instant

## Crushing PU Charge
Crushing PU Charge lets you gain PU gauge with every KO. If you get KOs often, this can allow you to extend your survivability through higher PU availability and even quickly get it back after if you keep getting kills. At levels 10-11 it grants 19-20% PU per kill, which means that you're guaranteed to get PU in 5 kills, but you will often get it sooner thanks to natural PU generation.

Leveling Crushing PU Charge will increase the amount of PU you gain per kill.
- Level 1: 1% PU
- Level 2: 2% PU
- Level 3: 3% PU
- Level 4: 4% PU
- Level 5: 5% PU
- Level 6: 15% PU
- Level 7: 16& PU
- Level 8: 17% PU
- Level 9: 18% PU
- Level 10: 19% PU
- Level 11: 20% PU

## Resist Heat
Resist Heat prevents fire abilities (such as the Todoroki Family's and Armored All Might) from inflicting the Burning status, however, it only does this for 1 hit, after which it enters a cooldown (which isn't even zero at maximum level) before you can get this fire immunity again. Because fire damage can only be applied by a select few characters, often does basically no damage, and this tune has a cooldown; it's often regarded as one of the worst special tunes in the whole game, being overly situational, trying to stop a gimmick that barely affects the player, and not even succeeding wholy at doing so. Don't bother with this tune, it's basically useless, no like really why does it even exist, why, why, why?????? WHY, WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS, I SWEAR TO 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/resistheat-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Resist Heat decreases its cooldown, allowing it to activate sooner.
- Level 1: 70s Cooldown
- Level 2: 65s Cooldown
- Level 3: 60s Cooldown
- Level 4: 55s Cooldown
- Level 5: 50s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 21s Cooldown
- Level 8: 17s Cooldown
- Level 9: 14s Cooldown
- Level 10: 10s Cooldown
- Level 11: 5s Cooldown

## Resist Shock
Resist Shock quickly cancels paralysis induced by electric moves that apply shockpower (Denki Kaminari only), however, it only does this for 1 hit, after which it enters a cooldown (which isn't even zero at maximum level) before you can get this paralysis immunity again. Because Denki Kaminari is the only character capable of paralyzing and this special tune has cooldown it is seen as one of the worst special tunes in the game, attempting to stop a very specific character but failing to do so properly. It's not as bad as Resist Heat, but still, don't use it, basically any other tune would work better even in the situation where Resist Shock would be at its peak of utility.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/resistshock-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Resist Shock decreases its cooldown, allowing it to activate sooner.
- Level 1: 70s Cooldown
- Level 2: 65s Cooldown
- Level 3: 60s Cooldown
- Level 4: 55s Cooldown
- Level 5: 50s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 21s Cooldown
- Level 8: 17s Cooldown
- Level 9: 14s Cooldown
- Level 10: 10s Cooldown
- Level 11: 5s Cooldown

## Willpower
Willpower allows the user to resist a hit that would otherwise kill them, triggering knockdown on themselves and surviving at 1 HP. This tune is actually quite liked due to it's "2nd Opportunity" effect, which on characters that can manage to run away at 1 HP without being killed is really good, but kinda less effective on characters that cannot get out from the situation they've been put into. Against multi-hit attacks, this tune might fail to trigger, DOWNing the user, which can be frustrating. This tune is also good for non-PUR costumes, as you can still survive a lethal hit with 1 HP, just less often. You can also use Willpower to land one extra hit on the enemy to kill them if you know they're low and you just needed one extra attack to finish them off.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/willpower-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Willpower decreases its cooldown, allowing it to be available sooner.
- Level 1: 12 minutes
- Level 2: 10 minutes
- Level 3: 9 minutes
- Level 4: 8 minutes
- Level 5: 7 minutes
- Level 6: 3 minutes and 30 seconds
- Level 7: 3 minutes
- Level 8: 2 minutes and 30 seconds
- Level 9: 2 minutes
- Level 10: 1 minute and 30 seconds
- Level 11: 1 minute


## Iron Fist
Iron Fist increases the user's damage by 5% after landing a basic melee attack. This effect lasts for 10 seconds, and has a cooldown 13-10 seconds cooldown at levels 10-11. While not the best damage increase out there, it can come handy on melee heavy characters (especially Izuku Midoriya OFA) to increase their damage output overall and trigger its effect often, especially effective when running it along with Embrittlement. It's not recommended on characters that don't land many melees or that don't want to land them too often, as the 10 seconds duration favors characters that can trigger it repeatedly. Not the best choice, but also not the worst.

Leveling Iron Fist decreases its cooldown, allowing you to trigger it sooner.
- Level 1: 60s Cooldown
- Level 2: 55s Cooldown
- Level 3: 50s Cooldown
- Level 4: 45s Cooldown
- Level 5: 40s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 22s Cooldown
- Level 8: 19s Cooldown
- Level 9: 16s Cooldown
- Level 10: 13s Cooldown
- Level 11: 10s Cooldown

## Ability Manifest
Ability Manifest allows the user to increase the duration of Ability Cards, allowing to expand on this mechanic. This is quite an interesting tune that can be used to either make Ability Cards a big plan of your playstyle, or simply to boost their duration whenever you need to make a little use of them, like when using a Support Ability Card after being struck with powerful skills (or to camp or heal inside the Poison Mist). 

Below is a comparison highlighting how much Ability Manifest increases the duration of Ability Cards at Level 11.
- Level 1: 5s -> 8s
- Level 2: 11s -> 18s
- Level 3: 17s -> 27s
- Level 4: 23s -> 37s
- Level 5: 29s -> 46s
- Level 6: 35s -> 56s
- Level 7: 41s -> 66s
- Level 8: 47s -> 75s
- Level 9: 53s -> 85s

Leveling Ability Manifest increases the duration of Ability Cards, allowing you to make them last longer.
- Level 1: +10% Duration
- Level 2: +15% Duration
- Level 3: +20% Duration
- Level 4: +25% Duration
- Level 5: +30% Duration
- Level 6: +35% Duration
- Level 7: +40% Duration
- Level 8: +45% Duration
- Level 9: +50% Duration
- Level 10: +55% Duration
- Level 11: +60% Duration

## Trance Blow
Trance blow allows the player to inflict the Trance status onto the enemy by landing a basic melee attack, slowing their Movement and Attack Speed, fogging their view and hiding ally tags. Trance Blow is really good when it comes to hindering the enemy and make it harder for them to escape, as they become much slower. However, the Trance status effect has a hidden variable that makes it a bad choice on characters that would normally seem like they'd love this tune, and that is the fact that Trance triplicates the amount of Downpower they receive, meaning that you won't be able to perform most combos on enemies with the Trance status (same applies for Shinso's gamma skill), for this very reason you should be mindful in who you give this tune to or how you decide to play around the Trance status.

Leveling Trance Blow decreases its cooldown, allowing you to inflict Trance more frequently.
- Level 1: 60s Cooldown
- Level 2: 55s Cooldown
- Level 3: 50s Cooldown
- Level 4: 45s Cooldown
- Level 5: 40s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 22s Cooldown
- Level 8: 19s Cooldown
- Level 9: 16s Cooldown
- Level 10: 13s Cooldown
- Level 11: 10s Cooldown

## Booming PU Voice
Booming PU Voice allows the user to send out soundwaves that apply the "Deafen" status to close enemies when activating PU, allowing you to stun them and use it as a combo starter, or making it easier to flee as they won't hear where you're going inside complex structures. While the utility it provides isn't bad, it being restricted to only activating on PU use really holds it back, as the one time you get to use it you won't even get much benefit from it if at all, plus, much better options exist both for this slot color and for PU activation effects. You don't really want to run this ever unless you want to try it out for the fun of it, but even then you will only have 1-2 attempts per match, and the range is also pretty short, shorter than Shinso's Level 9 gamma.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/boomingpuvoice-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Booming PU Voice decreases the duration of the Deafen effect, allowing it to last longer.
- Level 1: 4 seconds
- Level 2: 4.5 seconds
- Level 3: 5 seconds
- Level 4: 5.5 seconds
- Level 5: 6 seconds
- Level 6: 9 seconds
- Level 7: 9.5 seconds
- Level 8: 19 seconds
- Level 9: 10.5 seconds
- Level 10: 11 seconds
- Level 11: 12 seconds

## PU Power Intensified
PU Power Intensified is a powerful special tune that increases your overall damage by 50% (relative to Level 9) during Plus Ultra (which normally increases damage by 20%), allowing the player to deal massive damage to enemies that will often catch them off-guard. This special tune is incredibly powerful, but it also has a drawback, that being the fact that it lowers the time PU remains active. At maximum level, you lose 5 seconds out of the 15 that PU normally lasts, essentially losing 33% of your PU time. This can be a pretty huge drawback, since not only is this tune limited to PU, but you could also get stunned or knocked down and lose precious PU time. It's also the only special tune that actually makes the player weaker if used at low levels, where it makes PU last for only 3-4 seconds.

You can combine PU Power Intensified with Full Burn, a special tune that increases PU duration, but this mean you have to use two slots for a benefit you will only get during Plus Ultra, and whether it's worth it or not will depend on the character. On some characters, this combo can work well and get you many kills in crowded circles.

Contrary to what the icon might suggest, this special tune does not turn your PU aura red.

Leveling PU Power Intensified decreases the amount of PU Duration you lose from equiping this tune.
- Level 1: 3.5 seconds
- Level 2: 4 seconds
- Level 3: 4.5 seconds
- Level 4: 5 seconds
- Level 5: 5.5 seconds
- Level 6: 7.5 seconds
- Level 7: 8 seconds
- Level 8: 8.5 seconds
- Level 9: 9 seconds
- Level 10: 9.5 seconds
- Level 11: 10 seconds

## Revenge Strike
Revenge Strike increases your damage by 10% when an enemy breaks your guard. It's one of the only two choices for a red villain slot, and pretty much the only one people consider, as the other alternative Speedy Self-Revive isn't that good and works better when used as a Normal Tune rather than a Special one. Revenge Strike is alright, it's not the best, but also not the worst. Most of the time it's usage is carried by the fact that there's no better alternative for a red villain special slot.

Leveling Revenge Strike increases the duration of the DMG increase, allowing you to deal more damage for a longer amount of time.
- Level 1: 5 seconds
- Level 2: 5.5 seconds
- Level 3: 6 seconds
- Level 4: 6.5 seconds
- Level 5: 7 seconds
- Level 6: 14 seconds
- Level 7: 15 seconds
- Level 8: 16 seconds
- Level 9: 17 seconds
- Level 10: 18 seconds
- Level 11: 20 seconds

## Speedy Self-Revive
Speedy Self-Revive reduces the time it takes you to get up from the DOWNd state, reducing (at max level) the timer from 20 seconds to 8 seconds. On paper this can sound powerful, and it can indeed save your life occasionally, especially with a supportive team with shield characters, however, this is still too niche to be used frequently, as enemies will often finish your DOWNd body before 2-5 seconds of the timer have passed, especially considering that the timer only moves forward when you aren't being attacked or thrown away. Due to how rarely you will get to benefit from this effect, tunes that increase survivability to avoid being DOWNd in the first place are often preferred, plus, Strike Dabi's normal tuning gives extra Alpha DMG, which is pretty valuable on most characters.

Leveling Speedy Self-Revive decreases the DOWN timer's duration, allowing you to get up earlier.

- Level 1: Timer lasts 19 seconds
- Level 2: Timer lasts 18 seconds
- Level 3: Timer lasts 17 seconds
- Level 4: Timer lasts 16 seconds
- Level 5: Timer lasts 15 seconds
- Level 6: Timer lasts 14 seconds
- Level 7: Timer lasts 13 seconds
- Level 8: Timer lasts 12 seconds
- Level 9: Timer lasts 11 seconds
- Level 10: Timer lasts 10 seconds
- Level 11: Timer lasts 8 seconds

# Assault Special Tunes

## Speedy Civilian Rescue
Speedy Civilian Rescue allows the player to rescue civilians (including Kota) faster, which makes it a pretty good tune for support characters to quickly gather lots of HP/GP teamheals and revive cards, though not the most popular choice, as it can get overshadowed by other support-oriented tunes. This tune does not change the speed at which you rescue teammates.

An interesting yet fairly unknown strategy that some people opt for is to save as many civilians as possible not just for the support ranked points, but also to leave no civilians for other teams, making it harder for other teams to revive teammates.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/speedycivilianrescue-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Speedy Civilian Rescue increases its duration, allowing it to last for a longer amount of time throughout the match.
- Level 1: 1 minute
- Level 2: 1 minute 30 seconds
- Level 3: 2 minutes
- Level 4: 2 minutes 30 seconds
- Level 5: 3 minutes
- Level 6: 6 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 7: 8 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 8: 10 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 9: 12 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 10: 14 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 11: 20 minutes

## Space Hop
Space Hop allows the player to jump higher so long as they aren't inputting any direction (forward, backwards, left, right). This is one of the most loved special tunes and generally agreed to be among the best. Space Hop can be used to greatly avoid wake-up catches, especially on enemies that really want to use some abilities (mainly to escape) but can't due to startup lag and similar factors, such as Mr. Compress. On some characters it might allow to set up and advantageous situation without the need of using extra ability charges to accomplish so, such as Shinso with beta, Aizawa, both Endeavors or both Denki Kaminaris with their alpha and stun game. Space Hop also allows to more easily avoid some abilities, especially grounded ones.

Overall, Space Hop is very versatile, and works very well with most of the cast.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/spacehop2-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Space Hop increases its duration, allowing it to last for a longer amount of time throughout the match.
- Level 1: 1 minute
- Level 2: 1 minute 30 seconds
- Level 3: 2 minutes
- Level 4: 2 minutes 30 seconds
- Level 5: 3 minutes
- Level 6: 6 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 7: 8 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 8: 10 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 9: 12 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 10: 14 minutes 10 seconds
- Level 11: 20 minutes

## Indestructible
Indestructible gives the player the ability to have great resistance to flinching and knockdown by gaining superarmor after KOing and enemy. This tune can give you the upper hand in many instances of a battle, which makes it quite useful, however, the fact that you gotta KO somebody to gain this effect and it doesn't last that much makes it a rather unpopular choice. Normally, superarmor is nice because it lasts for 1 second or 2 in most cases/abilities, but Indestructible keeps this effect for long enough to be dangerous, as resistance to knockback means that you can more easily be thrown lots of damaging attacks before the game gives you invincibility frames.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/indestructible-gif.gif" width="600" />
</p>

Leveling Indestructible increases its duration, allowing it to last longer after KOing an opponent.
- Level 1: 10 seconds
- Level 2: 10.5 seconds
- Level 3: 11 seconds
- Level 4: 11.5 seconds
- Level 5: 12 seconds
- Level 6: 15 seconds
- Level 7: 16 seconds
- Level 8: 17 seconds
- Level 9: 18 seconds
- Level 10: 19 seconds
- Level 11: 20 seconds

## Sisterly Disposition
Sisterly Disposition gives the player a 30% Defense Boost for 10 seconds after landing a basic melee attack. What once was by far the best special tune is now a pretty tame tune, not bad but also far from the best. It's short duration paired with its cooldown limit the use you can get from it, especially since you kinda want to avoid taking damage, 30% is a strong defense boost but not enough to simply keep taking damage. Now, options like Embrittlement or Space Hop tend to appeal players way more.

Because you need to take more hits to die, your Effective Health (HP + GP) is higher for 10 seconds, here's how this increase looks like assuming you trigger it at full health:
- 475 Health characters will have 679 Effective Health
- 500 Health characters will have 715 Effective Health
- 550 Health characters will have 786 Effective Health
- 600 Health characters will have 858 Effective Health
- 650 Health characters will have 929 Effective Health

Leveling Sisterly Disposition shortens its cooldown, allowing you to trigger its effect more often.
- Level 1: 60s Cooldown
- Level 2: 55s Cooldown
- Level 3: 50s Cooldown
- Level 4: 45s Cooldown
- Level 5: 40s Cooldown
- Level 6: 25s Cooldown
- Level 7: 22s Cooldown
- Level 8: 19s Cooldown
- Level 9: 16s Cooldown
- Level 10: 13s Cooldown
- Level 11: 10s Cooldown

## Symbol of Peace
Symbol of Peace fills the player's PU gauge by a huge amount on match start and after being revived from a KO, which can be really useful for both aggressive players or people playing characters that might be more at risk of being eliminated. The ability to also refill a good chunk of it after being revived from a KO makes it a powerful tune for the lategame, as it won't take you long to get it to 100%, which might even help you if you struggle to find healing items and have no GP drinks. It also mitigates the emotional damage of dying with a full PU gauge.

Leveling Symbol of Peace increases the amount of PU refilled on match start and revival, allowing you to get closer to 100% PU.
- Level 1: +3% PU
- Level 2: +5% PU
- Level 3: +7% PU
- Level 4: +9% PU
- Level 5: +15% PU

## Full Burn
Full Burn extends the duration of Plus Ultra from the usual 15 seconds, allowing you to enjoy your increased PU damage and low cooldowns for a longer amount of time, with the only drawback being that you retain the cyan PU aura, which makes you more visible, and might make enemies focus you thinking you're low on health. Not the most popular choice but also not a bad one, some might dislike how it's tied to Plus Ultra, others might dislike the aura, but overall it's a nice DPS boost for whenever you're in danger. When combined with PU Power Intensified, it can be really powerful, as the duration you lose from PU Power Intensified is low in this case, allowing you to have a really powerful PU that also lasts almost double the usual duration, however this means you're using both of your special tuning slots on Plus Ultra mechanics, so outside Plus Ultra you will have no advantages.

Leveling Full Burn increases the duration of PU, allowing you to remain in this state for longer.
- Level 1: +2 seconds
- Level 2: +3 seconds
- Level 3: +4 seconds
- Level 4: +5 seconds
- Level 5: +6 seconds
- Level 6: +10 seconds
- Level 7: +11 seconds
- Level 8: +12 seconds
- Level 9: +13 seconds
- Level 10: +14 seconds
- Level 11: +15 seconds

At max level, Full Burn + PU Power Intensified last for 24-24.5 seconds depending on which of the two is on the right side.

## Revenge Assault
Revenge Assault grants the user a 20% Defense Boost when their guard is broken. It can be useful to mitigate some damage when you're in a difficult situation, and it has the plus side that anybody can afford this tune due to being from a free character. Mathematically speaking, it works better on higher HP characters, as you can take more reduced DMG hits, here's a little comparison showing the Effective HP of characters when this effect is active.

- 225 HP characters will have 282 Effective HP
- 250 HP characters will have 313 Effective HP
- 300 HP characters will have 375 Effective HP
- 350 HP characters will have 438 Effective HP
- 400 HP characters will have 500 Effective HP

This tune can work especially well with Revenge Support and self-sustain/immortal builds, seen mostly in Eijiro Kirishima (mostly Assault) and Technical Tomura Shigaraki.

Leveling Revenge Assault increases its duration, allowing you to retain this defense boost for longer after being guardbroken.
- Level 1: 5 seconds
- Level 2: 5.5 seconds
- Level 3: 6 seconds
- Level 4: 6.5 seconds
- Level 5: 7 seconds
- Level 6: 14 seconds
- Level 7: 15 seconds
- Level 8: 16 seconds
- Level 9: 17 seconds
- Level 10: 18 seconds
- Level 11: 20 seconds

## Embrittlement
Embrittlement decreases the enemy's defense by 10% after you land a basic melee attack, making the enemy more frail against not only your own attacks but also your teammates' and other enemies'. This a good choice often used on melee characters and sometimes even on non-melee characters to increase the overall DMG done to the enemy. It's often seen as the superior version of Iron Fist, as it has no cooldown, the damage increase is higher, and it even lets your teammates benefit from it. You can tell whether somebody has Embrittlement applied to them if they have a glitchy purple texture on them (which can also be given by Shigaraki's Special Action, but that one causes Defense DOWN too).

Characters like Izuku Midoriya OFA or both Kendos like having this special tune due to their ease to land basic melee attacks and how much they love to use them in their combos.

</p>

Leveling Embrittlement increases the duration of the Defense DOWN debuff, allowing it to last longer so you can squeeze more increased damage.
- Level 1: 2 seconds
- Level 2: 3 seconds
- Level 3: 4 seconds
- Level 4: 5 seconds
- Level 5: 6 seconds
- Level 6: 10 seconds
- Level 7: 11 seconds
- Level 8: 12 seconds
- Level 9: 13 seconds
- Level 10: 14 seconds
- Level 11: 15 seconds

## Quirk Factor Release
Quirk Factor Release doubles your reload speed for 10 seconds after breaking an enemy's guard. Even though it has a cooldown, it is a really good special tune, especially on characters that suffer from high cooldowns or simply benefit from having a specific skill back as soon as possible. Its versatily can make it useful both in battle (to get your strong skills back up sooner) and when fleeing (especially on characters whose mobility has a long cooldown). Because it's the only Yellow Villain special tune along with Embrittlement, it's also a saving grace for those who have good costumes with a yellow villain special slot on a character that has a harder time inflicting Embrittlement.

Leveling Quirk Factor Release shortens its cooldown, allowing you to trigger this effect sooner.
- Level 1: 2 minutes 
- Level 2: 1 minute 50 seconds
- Level 3: 1 minute 40 seconds
- Level 4: 1 minute 30 seconds
- Level 5: 1 minute 20 seconds
- Level 6: 40 seconds
- Level 7: 35 seconds
- Level 8: 30 seconds
- Level 9: 25 seconds
- Level 10: 20 seconds
- Level 11: 15 seconds
