Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) is an all-rounder character that excels at catching wake-ups. He differs from the average all-rounder by providing different utility in the form of inturuption with his alpha knockdown and beta grab. His burst damage is notably high at all ranges but he lacks armor and often struggles with mobility and survivability.<br>

## Alpha Skill - Create: Strike and Stop

Momo's alpha skill allows her to swing at enemies to stop non-armored abilities and cancel movement skills to lock and stagger enemies in place, which makes it hard for the enemy to escape if not spammed. It serves as a "back off" ability to either stop a threat attacking your allies or yourself. If the enemy jumps, one well-timed alpha instantly knocks them to the ground, and you can loop this so long as you're not interrupted. You can also sneak an alpha when setting up a combo involving the gamma skill for some extra damage. It should be noted that her alpha counts as a projectile, so abilities like Mr. Compress's beta shield will reflect it back to you.

## Beta Skill - Create: Unfalling Castle Wall

</p>
Momo's beta skill allows her to create a shield that can be used offensively, defensively, and supportively. When holding this ability, Momo will run forward with a shield that will block all incoming attacks so long as she takes them from the front, since Momo can't block non-directional attacks such as Ochaco's gamma (Both Rapid and Assault), or area attacks that come from behind her, as the shield does not cover her back. The ability to block attacks can be really useful against characters like Technical Todoroki that are usually hard to approach due to the large amounts of AoE attacks. However, this ability should not be used to run away, since even though it allows you to move faster, it leaves you exposed from behind while taking away your ability to dodge, rendering you vulnerable for a tiny speed boost.<br>
<br>
When the skill is tapped instead of holded (or at the end of the hold version) this ability does a good job at keeping yourself or your allies alive and buy you some time, as it can be used to cover an ally to give yourself some space to rescue them or let the timer run. It can also be used to block entrances/exits, either to prevent the enemy from reaching you/your teammates or to keep them trapped in a building and spam gamma cannons at them. This can also be useful to buy yourself time to heal or resurrect an ally.

## Gamma Skill - Create: Bullet Rain

Momo's gamma skill gives her the ability to place cannons that will shoot 3 cannonballs that will explode in smaller matryoshka bombs. This ability has insane range and DMG, being able to cause havoc from great distances. At higher levels (4 and 9) you get an extra cannon, which allows you to cover a greater area to make sure at least one hits (normally one targets the front, and the rest target the sides, this can be used to either hit the spot you predict your enemy will go to, or to prevent them from taking a specific path. A lone alpha should be sneaked in to maximize damage, but don't go for more or else you will risk putting the enemy on knockdown with an alpha rather than with a cannonball, losing valuable damage.<br>

</p>
<br>
Defensively, you can aim the cannons at a KOd ally's or enemy's remains to be able to loot while discouraging others from doing so and also giving you some protection against melee characters. If you're being chased, you can go indoors and place cannons in the way to discourage chasing, as the enemy will get hit badly if they decide to come inside anyways.

</p>
<br>
Additionally, these cannons can be aimed all the way up to shoot at the sky, doing this will make the cannonballs take a while to fall back and hit the ground, which makes it great for the small final circle, as people might think they're safe, that is, until the cannonballs finally land and hit them whole. It should also be added that each matryoshka bomb released from the cannonball's explosion deals about 50 DMG, which isn't much, but in tight spaces they can stack, leading to even greater DMG.

## Special Action - Yaoyorozu's Lucky Bag

</p>
Momo's special action allows her to summon a bag that will drop 4 to 5 items. It's recommended to use it at the beginning of the match to start with a large backpack, and if you're lucky, some extra levels. This ability should also be used when an ally is dead, this is because her Special Action spawns a resurrection card when this condition is met. Do this even if you already have one, as it never hurts to have 2 resurrection cards. The probability of getting each items is as follows:

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 3-string combo chain is useful to smack people out of their fake selves and accept their inner kittens. It's useful in the production of femboys.

**Air Melee**<br>
Momo's air melee spawns femmies real nice.

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
A path that keeps a balance between alpha and gamma levels, not neglecting the former. Once alpha and gamma are max level, you mostly care about beta being level 4, which you might already have thanks to ability cards. From here, you can either give the cards to your teammates or aim for beta level 9 if you're building a defensive setup.

### Why is Beta so low priority?
This ability is often countered, and level 1 allows you to cover a good chunk of entrances and exits already, plus, you often get there accidentally through ability cards. Meanwhile, alpha and gamma are abilities you will be actively using for both offense and defense, so you want those to be stronger.
