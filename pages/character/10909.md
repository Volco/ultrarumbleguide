# <a style="color: lightblue !important;">GACHA, BANNERS AND ROLLING</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about the Gacha and its banners and the depressive act of rolling for a character!

# The Gacha
This is the feature through which you obtain the vast majority of battle styles (term that refers to both characters and sets of skills), costumes, emotes ans voicelines. Normally, to roll on this banners you require of 10 Roll Tickets/1200 Hero Crystals for a single pull, or 100 Roll Tickets/12000 Hero Crystals for a 10-pull.

The gacha in this game does not have a pity system, but it has the "Points Exchange" system. Basically, every pull gives you 1 Exchange Point in that specific banner, and these points can be exchanged for the banner's featured costumes or battle styles/characters. 
- With 100 Exchange Points (the equivalent to 1000 Roll Tickets or 120,000 Hero Crystals) you can get a featured costume of your choice.
- With 200 Exchange Points (the equivalent to 2000 Roll Tickets or 240,000 Hero Crystals) you can get the banner's featured battle style, as well as the rest of the gacha-only battle styles matching the banner type.

If the banner goes away, the unspent Exchange Points will be converted into Hero Souls, but not kept as Exchange Points, keep that in mind. However, a cool thing about the gacha is that even if you get a featured costume or battle style, you don't lose these Exchange Points, which means that you can still give them a use by unlocking a costume you don't have or, if you're close enough to 200 Exchange Points, exchange them for another battle style you lack.

Duplicate items will be converted to Hero Souls, up to 200 (for Battle Styles) and nameplates if it's a duplicate battle style (each battle style has 3 nameplates linked to them, so getting a 4th duplicate won't give you a nameplate), however, duplicated costumes will unlock 1 tuning slot for that costume, which in the case of PUR costumes also means you unlock an extra aura for that costume.

There are 5 types of banner (sort of), these being:

## Original Character Roll
These are the most basic type of banner, here you can spend Roll Tickets or Hero Crystals for a chance to get the featured Original Battle Style (or the featured costumes). An Original Battle Style is the base set of skills the character released with, and the one you can play for free for a limited amount of daily uses using Rental Tickets. In these banners you can obtain or exchange points for the following battle styles:

</p>

## Alternative Character Roll
These are the other most basic type of banner, here you can spend Roll Tickets or Hero Crystals for a chance to get the featured Alternative Battle Style (or the featured costumes). An Alternative Battle Style is an alternative set of skills for that character in case you don't like the normal (original) battle style or simply like the alternative one more. You don't need the Original Battle Style to use the Alternative ones.

These are sometimes seen as more valuable to some players due to the fact that Rental Tickets cannot be used on Alternative Battle Styles, meaning you can only test them for free in Training Mode, not in actual matches. In these banners you can obtain or exchange points for the following battle styles:

## Costume Pick-Up Roll
These are special banners that focus on costumes (mainly for a specific character), and as such you cannot obtain Battle Styles from them. Unlike regular banners, you cannot use Roll Tickets on these, only Hero Crystals (10,000 to be precise), but the Exchange System still exists. Whether or not these are worth it is for you to decide. Compare odds by pressing "Drop Rates" and see if you're interested, normally the odds of obtaining a specific featured costume is 0.8% (featured battle styles are 1%), so most people don't think it's worth it, but if you really want that skin, you can give it a thought.

## Step Up Gacha
These are rare banners that use a special system. The way these work is that everytime you roll, you move one step further. Each step does different things, for example, the first step is usually free, then the second will ask you to spend an amount of Hero Crystals, and then the next might ask you a higher amount but will guarantee one of two battle styles (or costumes). If you've played 2D gachas, this should sound familiar.

## Special Banners
Here fall all unique banners. Each banner has its own rules so make sure to check their inner workings. Banners in this category can include the Anniversary Special Gacha and the Beginner Mission Gacha. The Beginner Mission Gacha allows you to get one random gacha-only Original Battle Styles by using a special ticket for that banner, which you get after completing every beginner mission.
