Ibara is a support-class character with a unique twist: she usually operates like a heavy sniper. Your objective is to keep enemies away from you and your team using your Alpha ability, hold key positions on the map, and turn the tide of battle with instant revives.<br>
<br>
As a key member of your team, and a non-mobility character, you will often be targeted by enemies, but with your large HP pool and high close-range Beta damage, you have every chance to stand your ground against even the strongest characters in the game.

## Alpha Skill - Purification
<p align="center">

</p>


Ibara's Alpha skill is a truly unique and powerful long-range attack. This ability features two firing modes: un-aimed and aimed.
The attack's uniqueness lies in the short-lived residual effect it leaves behind. Any enemy who steps or flies into it takes the full damage of the Alpha ability.

**Un-aimed Mode**<br>
In un-aimed mode, Ibara will spread her vines across a wide area with okay range, however, this version is significantly less likely to hit enemies, partly due to the gaps between each of her vines, and it's highly discourage to use this version of alpha against aerial targets, as the spread doesn't help much. This version is excellent for controlling chokepoints like doors and stairways, denying areas in rooms, or exposing enemies hiding in smoke or bushes, so for these situations un-aimed mode should be used.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a9-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Aimed Mode**<br>
Most of the time, your focus should be on the aimed mode rather un-aimed. In this mode, Ibara will fire a concentrated vine shot that deals high damage and has much longer range than her un-aimed version, and is also both ideal to hit air targets and a significantly more reliable version. Furthermore, two ticks of the alpha ability are guaranteed to knock enemies back, allowing you to maintain a safe distance, prevent an enemy from escaping, or shake a threat off your teammate.

If you catch an enemy mid-air with aimed alpha and hit on health (or guardbreak), if you're fast enough and they recover slow you can land a well placed follow-up alpha.

</p>

**Barrier Piercing**<br>
A crucial feature of Ibara's Alpha is its ability to pierce through enemies and many of their defensive mechanisms. This allows it to damage multiple opponents in a line, even if they are protected by shields. Below there is a list of skills that Ibara's Alpha can pierce through.

</p>

It's important to remember that some defensive mechanisms are considered terrain and cannot be pierced by Ibara's Alpha. These include all of Cementoss's structures, Shoto Todoroki's ice walls and icicles, Momo's shield in deployed state, and Full Bullet’s Gamma. When colliding with these obstacles, Ibara's Alpha will attempt to move around them or over them, following the same rules as with any map geometry.

**Mastering your Alpha: Feel The Flow**<br>
Ibara's Alpha is a finicky yet fascinating ability with incredibly diverse interactions with map terrain. Unleash your imagination and head into training mode. Start shooting at everything you see and observe the Alpha's behavior. It is far from intuitive, especially for a new player. Below are examples of some of the most common interactions.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a6-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a7-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a8-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Trajectory Thinking**<br>
A vital step towards fully mastering Ibara's Alpha is to start thinking in terms of its trajectory. Recall how you play other characters. Most often, a character's Alpha skill is a projectile resembling a sphere—a single point that must directly connect with an enemy's hitbox.

With Ibara's Alpha, however, you are not firing a point, but an entire line that persists in the air for a short time. Simply put, you don't need to aim directly at the enemy's model. It's often enough to shoot at their feet, and the Alpha will extend to reach them. If an enemy is climbing a wall, you can shoot at its base. If they are flying through the air, you can create a barrier in their path that they will fly into.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a10-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Accept the Randomness**<br>
Ibara's Alpha can be random. This is barely visible in aimed mode but you can clearly see it in un-aimed mode. Randomness causes unintended behavior that is simply beyond your control. Sometimes it favours you, sometimes it doesn’t.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Value your ammo**<br>
Even at level 9, Ibara only has 4 Alpha charges. At level 1, she has a mere 2. Every shot is a chance to deal up to 160 damage (depending on your level) and knock an enemy back. Every miss leaves you vulnerable and allows enemies to close the distance.

The cost of any mistake on a low-mobility character is incredibly high. Treat every miss as a significant mechanical error. Dedicate yourself to training your accuracy and constantly improving. Most importantly, avoid situations where you spend all your Alpha charges in the heat of battle and are left with none.
<br>
<br>

## Beta Skill - Via Dolorosa
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch102_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Ibara's Beta skill lets loose a wide blast of vines, knocking down any opponent that gets in its range. This ability has tracking, but sometimes its behavior can be unpredictable at extra close range.

The blast from the Beta consists of three zones. The central zone of the blast goes the farthest and deals up to 60 damage. The vines from the central zone can also bounce off surfaces. Another two areas are located to the left and to the right of your character. They don’t bounce and have shorter range, but deal slightly more damage. If your enemy is close enough, all three zones will add up, resulting in very high damage. Note that hitting an enemy with at least two zones is required to inflict a hard knockdown. However, enemies with Super Armor will only be knocked if they are hit by all three zones simultaneously.

This move grants Super Armor, significantly reducing the chance you'll be interrupted during its animation. This allows you to effectively trade damage with opponents. A well-timed Beta will knock your enemy down while you remain standing, creating a huge advantage to catch their wake up.

This is a great counter in most melee engagements, stopping aggressors that try to flank and catching anyone that tries to flee. This ability is especially effective in choked areas. Keep in mind that your Beta is also an excellent wake up catching tool. Its lingering hitbox and devastating damage melts impatient players who don’t take full advantage of their i-frames, which is typical for a certain list of high-mobility characters.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200b-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200b2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Gamma Skill - Crucifixion
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch102_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Crucifixion is a grab that deals damage directly to the target's HP, bypassing their GP. Its main weakness is its extremely short range, making it difficult to land. Upon a successful grab, Ibara deals 7 ticks of HP damage for a decent amount of damage. On the eighth tick, she throws the enemy away, dealing a final burst of damage based on the ability's skill level. This skill also has a unique property that makes it so that the skill is only consumed when catching an enemy with it, as missing it will not consume your gamma charge.

A significant downside of this move is that Ibara remains completely stationary for the entire animation, making her an easy target. However, the grab can be canceled early. While this will sacrifice some damage ticks, it allows you to land the final throw and, most importantly, free yourself from the vulnerable state much sooner. Remember, Ibara's Gamma grants her Super Armor, which means she doesn't flinch from attacks but will still absorb all the incoming damage, often leading to her taking more damage than usual during the animation.

Another major downside is random teammates. When your allies see you holding an opponent in your grasp, they want to capitalize on it and will often knock your enemies from your grasp much earlier than intended resulting in a loss of the final and most damaging hit of the Gamma and making the levels you invested into it go to waste.

Despite previous criticism, Gamma ability is still a very strong tool in the hands of skilled players. It can be used as an alternative wake-up punisher and, with the right tuning build, can even one-shot certain characters. Moreover, it’s a great tool against enemies in Plus Ultra state, since they might be low on HP. However, utilizing it effectively demands strong game sense, match-up knowledge, and precise timing.

If you are a new player and don’t feel confident in your Gamma, don’t force it, this skill is very punishable. The feeling will come naturally as you learn the character. Another effective tactic for using your Gamma is to lure enemies around a corner and catch them as they chase you. This strategy is especially deadly if you manage to catch someone in the storm.

## Special Action - Faith's Shield
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch102.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Ibara's Special Action is an incredibly powerful ability and her true killer feature. She carries two instant revives with a pretty long range. Using this ability wisely can single-handedly turn the tide of a battle, which is why you will constantly be the primary target for other teams. To revive an ally, you do not require a direct line of sight; the ability works through walls and other obstacles, even if you or your teammate are in the air. Using this ability mid-air will stop you from falling for a moment.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200s-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

It’s crucial to feel the range of this ability. Despite its long range, teammates tend to scatter around, and sometimes, they can get too far from you. Make sure to close range with your ally before they get DOWNd.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A simple 3-hit melee chain. Despite having a deceitfully wide-looking slash, Ibara slows down before every attack, so the range on these is too short to be used reliably. Ibara prefers using her Beta and Gamma skills to repel close-range aggression. Despite being an unreliable tool, Ibara has several niche combos that start off her melees. They will be described later.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

A single slash with thorny hair. It is slightly more reliable than her original ground melee chain because this is literally the only skill in Ibara’s kit that doesn’t slow her down.

## Leveling Paths
### Alpha Level 4 is a must
Your combat potential before reaching Alpha level 4 is incredibly low. With only two charges, you will often be useless in fights. That third charge, along with the extra range and larger projectile size, is crucial for your consistency. Remember, you start the game with two revives. Sometimes, the correct play is to let a teammate be downed so you can secure the early levels you desperately need, just make sure you’re close enough to save them. Getting drawn into early battles can leave you under-leveled, and failing to hit Alpha level 4 will have severe, long-lasting consequences for your entire match. Landing on an uncontested golden box to secure your loot is a good strategy to hit your Alpha level 4 ASAP.

<hr style="height: 5px; background-color: white; border: none;">

### Balanced Path A
This is a balanced build path. After getting Alpha to level 4, proceed to upgrade Beta to level 4. The level 1 Beta has a very small range, which leaves you vulnerable to close-range aggression. Securing Beta level 4 allows you to protect yourself much more effectively. Afterwards, prioritize Alpha level 9 to become a formidable long-range fire support.

</p>

### Balanced Path B
This is another viable path, focused on close-quarters combat and zone control. The level 9 Beta is an incredibly strong, nuke-like attack that melts your enemies and is excellent for catching opponents on their wake-up. You should use this path if there are a lot of melee threats in your lobby, or if you are forced inside a building during the final circles of a match.

</p>

### Balanced Paths Tip
If you are not confident in your playstyle and don't know which path to choose, let random guide you. Get to a4 → b4 first, and then start saving your upgrade cards in your inventory. Both level 9 skills provide a significant power spike. You will eventually find your Alpha and Beta cards, and your teammates might even bring you some.
You should use your universal cards (Level-Up Cards) right before a fight to secure key levels first. For example, let's say you have Alpha level 5 and Beta level 8 before a fight and only 3 universal cards. Use them to get that Beta level 9 and invest any remaining cards into your Alpha before you engage.

<hr style="height: 5px; background-color: white; border: none;">

### Sniper Path
Sniper path is viable for experienced players in a coherent team if they trust their aiming abilities. The downside of this path is that you’re leaving yourself vulnerable to close range threats and give up on catching your enemies on wake up.

On the other hand, you receive a significant range and projectile size boost earlier in the game. Your alpha is a great third-partying tool  and a great fire support for your teammates. It disrupts your opponent's moves and prevents them from escaping, which makes this path especially good for snowball tactics if your teammates are competent.

Space Hop users may prefer this path over balanced paths because high jump allows you to evade some close-ranged threats even in open areas and provide you with unexpected, long angles to shoot.

</p>

### Why don't we recommend level up Gamma?
Gamma is a high-risk, high-reward tool. Missing it leaves you completely vulnerable. Furthermore, leveling up Gamma only increases its release damage. In many situations, your teammates can knock the enemy out of your grasp, causing you to miss out on that key source of damage entirely.
While its purpose is to punish close-range aggression, your Beta ability is a more reliable and consistent tool that fully covers this need without the same associated risk.

## Techs
### Air Stalling
All your moves lock you in place and stops you from falling. If you find yourself high in the air, you can delay your falling by shooting your Alpha or spamming your Gamma. Gamma skill has a very short cooldown if it doesn’t catch anyone.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Safe Shooting
If Ibara is standing behind a fence or a similar obstacle, her hair may go over said obstacle and hit your opponents behind it, while they can’t directly attack you back. It works best with un-aimed mode, but happens with both. Another safe shooting trick is to shoot from above building entrances.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10200t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Split Shooting
Firing your un-aimed Alpha at corners or doorways will cause it to split, dealing damage to both sides of the obstacle. You can also split your aimed Alpha, but it’s hard to control and affects a much smaller area. Another niche interaction is 180 split. Face the wall and fire down on the floor without aiming. Your alpha will attack both ways.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Ibara's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 50 DP (Each Unaimed DMG Instance), 150 DP (Full Unaimed Shot), 100 DP (Each Aimed DMG Instance, 200 DP (Full Aimed Shot)<br>

Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1, Melee 2), 200 DP (Melee 3), 400 DP (Chain Total)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>

<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### Melee 1 -> Beta
Another niche combo to add 25 damage to your beta if the situation is right. This combo allows you to deal 236 damage, but most of the time, you’d rather not risk missing a melee.

</p>

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Alpha (Aimed)
A very niche combo that is worth using only in a situation, where you don’t have your beta. It’s much harder to land, but the damage is very similar. Allows you to deal damage above beta's up close.

### Air Melee -> Gamma
A highly dangerous combo that combines high damage with target control. It locks an enemy in place to deal 295 damage before tuning, with 225 of it going straight to HP, ignoring shields.

### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Gamma
This is another combo based on a similar principle. It locks the opponent in place for an even longer duration, dealing 325 total damage. However, it only works reliably in an isolated 1v1 scenario. Keep in mind that landing a ground melee could be harder than air melee.

### Air Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Gamma
This is a less reliable version of the previous combo. While it deals 50 extra damage, it's trickier to execute. You must use your air melee close to the ground to have enough time to land and follow up with two basic melee attacks. Be careful not to knock the enemy too far away, and ensure they don't land on higher ground. If you're uncertain about the timing, simply use your Gamma ability before the basic attacks to guarantee the combo.

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Alpha (Aimed) -> Gamma
Ibara's most damaging combo but also the most situational one. This combo only works on GP as it needs the elevation provided by air melees on HP characters. In order to execute this combo, you must hit Air Melee as close to the ground (and to the target) as possible to make them gain some air and then stun them with Melee 1. Then you will use aimed alpha against the ground while turning your camera a bit to the left to line up the vines perfectly. The target will fall into the alpha, receiving damage, but if you're quick enough they will only take 1 instance of the alpha's DMG, allowing you to gamma. It can be tricky to pull as sometimes you might hit the whole alpha, but if it works that's 400 or more DMG. Technically it's also possible to do this combo with unaimed alpha, where you get the exact same damage by landing 2 out of the 3 instances of damage, but the endlag of unaimed alpha is higher than the aimed version, so it's drastically less consistent.
