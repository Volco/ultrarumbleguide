The Symbol of Peace is BACK with a new arsenal inspired by his beloved Class 1-A! From beaming, combos, mobility, the Symbol of Peace is back to steal the spotlight! 

Armored All Might is a mid/close ranged fighter that is incredibly versatile and literally has something for every situation. Use alpha to fight from afar, beta for burst damage and combo setups, and gamma to protect yourself even when you’re getting hit!

## Alpha Skill - Ice Bullet Shot/Flame Bullet Shot

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br> <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique1_2.png" width="400" />
</p>

Armored All Might’s alpha has two different versions depending on whether or not you’re in Aim Mode. If you’re in Aim Mode you’ll use Flame Bullet Shot and if you’re not in Aim Mode you’ll use Ice Bullet Shot. While using alpha you can hold down the alpha input and it’ll fire at a faster rate unlike other alphas where you have to keep pressing the input to fire multiple shots. Both versions are used for different things so let’s start with Ice Bullet Shot.


### Ice Bullet Shot</br>
Ice Bullet Shot is a low damage alpha that is capable of freezing an enemy after 3 shots are landed on the same target and the freeze is comparable to Strike Todoroki’s gamma. This version of alpha is only really used as a combo starter as its damage is pretty low. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200a-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

### Flame Bullet Shot</br>
Now this version of alpha is the one you’ll most likely be using a lot more. It does good damage and then 70 true damage over time doing 10 burn damage per tick with 7 ticks. This version of alpha has multiple uses like beaming and ending combos. The 70 true damage is present no matter the level of alpha so it’s very good at weakening foes for your teammates. A common technique to help mitigate the slower camera from Aim Mode is to aim first then use Aim Mode to use Flame Bullet Shot so you retain your faster camera while still having access to firing Flame Bullet Shot.

## Beta Skill - Blackwhip Charge Bolt/Blackwhip Cellophane
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br><img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique2_2.png" width="400" />
</p>

Beta is versatile but not quite as versatile as Drone Anima. It is a very potent burst damage, mobility, and combo starter tool that you should definitely keep your eye on the cooldown for as you’ll be using beta a ton. From now on I will be referring to Blackwhip Charge Bolt as Blackbolt and Blackwhip Cellophane as Blackphane for brevity sake.

### Blackwhip Charge Bolt</br>
Blackbolt is a very good burst damage option that locks an opponent in place for the entirety of its time doing damage which is incredibly powerful for teammates with low down power moves so they can pile on extra damage. This Quirk Skill is also really good as a combo ender as its good damage can make some combos do much more damage and possibly even down from 400 HP without tuning. Using Blackbolt does keep YOU in place as well if you manage to hit someone with it so keep that in mind when using it in a crowded area where other players can get cheap shots on you. This version of beta can only be used while you’re on the ground and does NOT pull you towards opponents or the environment like Blackphane does. While using Blackbolt you can cancel the animation with a grounded melee.

</p>

### Blackwhip Cellophane</br>
Blackphane is where his utility starts getting better. Blackphane will pull you towards wherever it hits whether it be the environment or other players letting you use Blackphane for mobility or as a combo starter. There is also a special hit box when using Blackphane that is only present when one of these two scenarios occur:

- You use Blackphane on the environment and run into a foe
- You use Blackphane on a foe and you are positioned directly above or under them

This special hit box will be referred to as an “air bash” from now on. While using Blackphane you can cancel the movement with a beta input which has some niche uses in combos but is also good if you need to prematurely stop during Blackphane’s mobility.

## Gamma Skill - Drone Anima
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Drone Anima is his best Quirk Skill by far and it’s not even close. Drone Anima is a combo breaker, combo starter, extra damage output during combos, a way to perform fly by attacks with tracking projectiles, a 100 damage burst option, and it staggers after 2 drones even on GP. It definitely has a lot going for it and should always be out 24/7 no matter what unless you are trying to hide as the drones can give you away. As for how it actually works you press gamma once and he will summon drones that follow him and aim towards where his camera is looking and will track onto the person closest to the center of your screen. You can either tap gamma to fire one drone or hold gamma to fire all remaining drones all at once. Once his gamma reaches 0% all remaining drones will automatically be fired wherever his camera is facing. You can also fire drones during your own actions like in the middle of firing an alpha or opening an Item Box for example. The damage on the drones does not increase on level ups so it is a consistent 100 damage option once gamma reaches level 4. The drones do have some tracking but it isn’t anything crazy so don’t expect them to make crazy turns around corners to hit someone. A very strong aspect of the drones is you can shoot them out even when you are taking damage meaning you can shoot out two drones to stagger the enemy and interrupt their combo. You only need two drones to stagger an enemy even if they are on GP and that stagger is great for breaking out of combos like previously mentioned and for starting combos. It is highly recommended to get gamma to level 4 first no matter what kind of play style you have so you can have 4 drones instead of 3 enabling you to stagger opponents twice per gamma activation instead of just once.

## Special Action - Thruster Uravity/Thruster Ingenium
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch200.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Special Action is an insane movement option that gives him the ability to catch up with even the fastest characters in the game or fly up into the air to completely counter some characters who struggle with aerial threats. Thruster Uravity is used when Armored All Might goes up with his Special Action while Thruster Ingenium is used when Armored All Might goes forward with his Special Action.
</p>

### Thruster Uravity</br>
Pressing the jump input in the air activates Thruster Uravity and you can choose to hold jump to continue gaining height or tap jump to hover similarly to Nejire and Endeavor. You can reach some insane heights by holding jump with max Special Action to the point where you very easily reach the skybox or at least get very close to it. Holding jump does take a decent amount of Special Action if you do decide to hold it so keep that in mind when managing your Special Action. The hover version doesn’t take that much Special Action per tick so you can hover for quite a while which lets you like stated before keep in the air so you can counter enemies who thrive on the ground but struggle facing aerial foes. A niche thing you can do is start drinking a healing item, drop off a ledge, and then tap/hold jump to fly while continuing your drinking. This does not apply to Thruster Ingenium. Using Thruster Uravity does not end your invincibility frames early and is an amazing wake up option as you gain height so fast it’s hard for characters to punish you after your invincibility frames are over. Even characters with big AOEs like All For One with his gamma have trouble catching you if you use Thruster Uravity on wake up.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Thruster Ingenium</br>
This version of Special Action will have you zipping around the map at ludicrous speeds. Like Thruster Uravity there are two ways to use this version of Special Action and that is by either tapping or holding Special Action respectively and both of these versions can be used both in the air and on the ground. By tapping Special Action you get a burst of speed where Armored All Might is facing and it takes 20% of his Special Action. The hold version makes him perform a longer dash that covers a great distance and takes 80% of his Special Action. Do note that you can perform either of these even if you only have 1% of his Special Action. When using the hold version of Special Action you can cancel the dash early by pressing Special Action again or using a melee, and when using the tap version of Special Action you can cancel it early by using a melee. Do note that using Thruster Ingenium ends your invincibility frames early so it is not advised to use it on wake up.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Basic Attacks
### Ground Melee</br>
A two hit string that starts with a punch propelling Armored All Might forward and ends with an explosion that knocks the opponent back far from where the punch started. This melee has some tracking to it and the explosion hit is very good at catching wake ups due to its delayed hit box. It is possible to combo the first hit of grounded melee into itself once and then do the explosion hit for extra damage. The grounded melee also has a degree of movement you can perform with it by holding a direction after you start a Melee 1. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

## Air Melee <br>
The character is the first one to have a three hit air melee string and he makes VERY good use of it. Air melee can be used as a combo starter if coming in with your Special Action and is a main proponent in many of his combos. The first and last hit of his air melee string propels Armored All Might forward which isn’t particularly useful but still good to keep in mind just in case.

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
A path that lets you spam alphas as soon as possible. Gamma 4 because the fourth drone is too good with its utility, alpha 9 for alpha’s max effectiveness early, beta 4 so you can reposition with its increased range, gamma 9 to aid gamma’s utility, and beta 9 last since if you’re beaming from the sky you probably aren’t going to be using beta for damage much.

</p>

### Balanced Path
A balanced path that makes him better able to handle all situations with more alpha damage early letting him fare better against distant enemies compared to the Combo Path. Gamma 4 because gamma's utility is amazing, beta 4 for the range increase so you can reposition better, and alpha 4 for the gauge consumption reduction and size increase. Beta 9 lets you reposition more often and gives him his very nice burst damage, gamma 9 so your drones are out longer, and alpha 9 so you can bring out your full ranged power.

</p>

### Combo Path
A very combo oriented path that enables his high damage grounded beta finishers early. Gamma 4 gets him his fourth drone which is invaluable and beta 9 increases his mobility and damage greatly so he can get in close and do some damage. Alpha 4 is before gamma 9 because alpha also does good damage and the freeze is a good combo starter if you can land it and is more impactful than gamma 9. Gamma 9 is before alpha 9 however because the increase in time the drones can be out is incredibly good and the reload speed increase at level 9 is also very appreciated.

</p>

### Why is Gamma Lvl.9 always recommended second to last?
Gamma level 9's increase in time the drones can be out makes unable to be combo'd for even longer than level 4, which increases his survivability greatly.It also lets you have a great combo starter up for even longer.

## Techs
### Thruster Boost
A nice way to get some extra distance out of Thruster Ingenium via melee cancelling. All it is is at the end of either your tap or hold version of Special Action you do a grounded Melee 1 since grounded Melee 1 propels Armored All Might a good distance. You can also take advantage of the degree of control you get after Melee 1 with this tech. Doing this tech with an air melee isn't as good since you don't go nearly as far as a grounded melee. Both air and grounded melee can be used to cancel your tap Special Action early in case you need to stop for whatever reason just make sure that if it's the grounded melee to also turn to the side so you can avoid going forward.

</p>

        
## Combos
These are different ways you can squeeze as much damage as possible out of Armored All Might’s entire move set while conforming to the 500 down power (DP) restriction. The down power of each of Armored All Might’s moves are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill - 

Ice Bullet Shot - 50<br>
Flame Bullet Shot - 125
<br>

Beta Skill -

Blackbolt’s Grab - 100<br>
Blackbolt’s Continuous Damage - 0<br>
Blackbolt’s Finishing Throw - 500

Blackphane’s Grab - 200<br>
Blackphane’s Air Bash - 100
<br>

Gamma Skill - 90 per drone
<br>

Ground Melee 1 - 200<br>
Ground Melee 2 - 300
<br>

Air Melee 1 - 50<br>
Air Melee 2 - 50<br>
Air Melee 3 - 400
<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

Since Armored All Might’s drones can be activated mid-action if a drone(s) can be used in a combo for extra damage without needing to be used at a specific point in the combo an extra parameter will be present above the combo listing the max amount of drones you can use for extra damage without breaking the combo. The damage calculation will be calculated assuming you used the max number of extra damage drones listed. 

For combos that require an additional stun with gamma if performed on GP shoot drones a half-second after the Air Melee 2 and if performed on HP wait until Armored All Might slides past the enemy and then shoot the drones. If you mistime the drones the enemy will not get staggered again and they can break out of the combo easier.


### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2

A basic combo that you can do if you manage to land a raw Melee 1 on someone though the timing on the second Melee 1 is tight if you want it to be true on GP.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)</a>

A combo you can perform on an enemy you hit a Blackphane on directly above them to get the air bash hit box.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Blackbolt -> Gamma (hold)

Another basic combo that sacrifices all of your drones for good burst damage. You can alternatively use your drones to stagger first and then hit the Blackbolt.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Blackbolt -> Gamma 2x -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2

A combo that you can use when close to an opponent and land a Blackbolt as your first move. This combo utilizes cancelling the Blackbolt early with a grounded melee for extra damage compared to the previous combo. Make sure you are using your Melee 1 on the last possible damage tick of Blackbolt for maximum damage which with no tuning would be 80 damage. With the drones it would become 130 before you melee because 80 + 50 = 130.

</p>

### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) 

A useful combo to know for when you hit a Blackphane on a grounded enemy. Make sure you are only doing the Gamma 2x after the two air melees so you can keep the enemy staggered to confirm the Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot).

</p>

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">Air Melee 1</a> -> Air Melee 2 -> Air Melee 3

A solid air combo that you can perform on aerial foes hit with Blackphane. Armored All Might’s air melee tracking is a bit strange so this combo will sometimes miss the enemy even if your camera is turned to face them.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a>

An untrue, but more damaging combo you can perform on a grounded enemy you hit with Blackphane. The Blackbolt becomes more consistent with the help of Acceleration or Rapid Ability Cards. Since this combo is untrue it is not recommended to use this combo on someone like Mirio or other characters with quick combo breaker options unless you have a way to hasten your attack speed.

### Blackphane (On environment) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 ->  Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A situational combo that you won’t be hitting much, but if you run into someone on the ground while using Blackphane for movement you can perform this combo on them. The air melee problem is also present here so this combo isn’t the most consistent. Also make sure that you are pressing the beta input again after the air bash connects so you can perform the air melees as failing to do so will just keep moving Armored All Might past the enemy.

</p>

### Extra Damage Drones: 2
### Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A combo you can use while grounded or in the air and manage to freeze someone. The hardest part about the combo is landing the freeze as some characters can easily evade your alphas but once the enemy is frozen it’s a free guard break for you. If you want to guarantee the freeze shoot the two drones out first to stagger the enemy and that buys you enough time to get the three Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot)s off.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackbolt -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a> -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A combo with tight timing that heavily utilizes the melee cancel that can be performed during Blackbolt. Make sure to time your melee cancel after your Blackbolt has done 80 damage (without tuning) as that is the last tick of damage before it sends the enemy into a hard knock down. Becomes more consistent with attack speed increases. The Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) is true, but since it does not hard knock down the enemy can attack you during it if they react fast enough.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Air Melee 3

A combo to use when you hit a Blackphane directly under an opponent to utilize the air bash property of Blackphane.

## Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Blackbolt -> Gamma 2x

A combo that does better damage than the previous freeze combo but requires you to be grounded when the freeze happens unlike the previous freeze one. It is recommended to hit the Blackbolt first instead of trying to hit the drones first so you can guarantee all the damage as if you try to do the drones first you might be too slow and miss the Blackbolt. Alternatively you can shoot out the two gammas before the Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot)s to confirm the freeze.

</p>

## Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A true version of the next combo that does less damage. Good if you want to confirm damage with no fear of the enemy breaking out. The clause of the freeze being tricky to apply applies here too. You can again shoot the two gammas early to confirm the freeze.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Blackphane (On environment) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 ->  Gamma 2x -> Blackbolt

A more damaging version of the combo mentioned previously that instead ends with Blackbolt instead of Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot). The same issues of the combo being situational, the air melee having weird tracking, and needing to press the beta input again when the air bash connects all apply here too. This combo is not recommended to be performed when the foe’s allies are nearby as they will punish you during your Blackbolt animation.

<p align="center">

An untrue, but very punishing combo if you manage to land a freeze on a grounded enemy and are close to them. Again, only recommended to perform this combo if you have a way to quicken your attack speed.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>This tuning like all melee tunings on this character is incredibly easy to activate and makes him a combo demon. The extra movement speed is a nice bonus but you’re mainly using this tuning to make his combos harder to escape from as the more damaging ones are untrue.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Embrittlement is basically a free 10% damage increase on the target due to how easy it is to land melees and how much he melees in his combos.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br> If you have trouble tracking enemies Perception combined with this character’s movement almost ensures that you’ll be able to catch up to them and finish them off.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch016_00.png" width="125"> | **Special Attack Reload Boost** <br>This character’s main mobility comes from Special Action so having a way to have it basically always up for a bit after inflicting a DOWN is invaluable. This tune also allows you to use your hold Special Action on the ground and regain Special Action at the same time.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>Basically a get out of jail free card whenever your guard is broken. You can use this time to fly into the air and then dash away to safety. Attacking will end the Permeation early and if you’re fast enough with inputs you can drink a small GP or HP or even a big GP drink if the attack that guard broke you was not a knock down.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>When you guard break someone ALL your cooldowns get a very nice reload boost which helps keep his beta, gamma, and Special Action off cooldown which is very strong. The preference for Special Attack Reload Boost and Quirk Factor Release depends on whether or not you want a ludicrously fast Special Action reload speed or a decently fast reload speed on all your abilities.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder** <br>This character’s movement is disgusting to the point where you’re most likely reaching Kota before the rest of the lobby even has a chance to get close, letting you and your team get a free +3 levels to all your Quirk Skills.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Armored All Might has no problem fighting early so this tune lets him level up quickly for an early power spike. Once you’re max level you can give your extra level cards to teammates and once their max you can level up your Ability Cards.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Essentially an extra life which is huge on a character that can get away from situations very easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>20% Plus Ultra charge on every KO lets Armored All Might snowball the entire match since he has more than enough damage and utility to consistently KO opponents the entire match.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_02.png" width="125"> | **Hyper Regeneration** <br>Armored All Might can guard break very easily which means he’ll be constantly healing both HP and GP passively during a fight. A really nice tune if you’re especially aggressive since it can let you stay in fights longer before needing to heal.|

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
There will rarely be a situation where you can't shoot the Deku but he can, so even though Assault Deku has more range, your superior damage and melee game should let you win. Watch out for blackwhip combos if you go into the air with gamma or decide not to beta cancel the endlag on beta, as these are very open windows for Deku to shoot you.
<br>
## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Your choice of level path dramatically changes this match-up depending on their level path. A Full Bullet with alpha level.4 will usually beat a full bullet with beta level.4 unless you're fighting near very tight buildings. Aside from that, it's a mirror match, so whoever plays best will win.

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Bakugo is very simular to Assault Deku, except he trades the range for high burst from beta-alpha and beta-gamma combos. Keep in mind that due to Strike Bakugo's startup-laggy wake-up options, he's much more prone to being catched with beta on his wake-up than almost any other member in the cast. You should win in a ranged fight or close ranged fight, but if bakugo gets the jump with a beta-alpha combo you can find yourself struggling.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Bakugo's alpha damage is high enough to challenge you quite well, but like regular Bakugo, he doesn't have good wake-up options. If you're feeling spicy you can catch his gamma before the explosion comes out with your beta heel, but this is risky and hard to do. If you can hit him out of the air then you'll do fine.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Ochaco is able to stack on large damage against you very easily if you use beta or gamma by catching your landing with her gamma. If you get hit by Ochaco's gamma you will lose the fight so be careful and keep yourself grounded and out of endlag so you can always roll it. If the Ochaco tries to spam cars at you in GP you can break the combo even in the air with alpha since she leaves small windows in between betas where you can land alphas, which will knock her down afterl anding the second.
<br>


## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Assault Ochaco is full of endlag-heavy options with her alpha and beta. If you can get good at catching her beta while she's running with alphas you should win almost every time. Just be weary of gamma and try to stick to alphas against her, since her beta will interrupt your melee options very easily and effectively.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Iida outputs more damage from close distance and has armored options, so getting close is very risky. He's also able to break the wake-up catches with alpha or beta if he's smart. If your aim is unreasonably good then alphas is your best answer to Iida, but he's the hardest character to hit in the game with projectiles so good luck. Your best option is to try and catch him while he's burned out with alphas or by punishing the endlag of beta by rolling it and shooting an alpha. Trying melee options is often quite risky. Jump beta can beat out a reckless iida but be weary that if you dont hit him away with the beta then you'll lose half or more of your total HP/GP from an Iida combo.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Strike Shoto's range isn't the issue here, the issue is his gamma being able to greatly punish your beta, causing you to lose most of your health, and beta cancels dont help here since gamma doesn't block shotos gamma. Getting close is also a risky option since Strike Shoto's beta beats you out quite easily. To win use your vertical mobility to get high out of his beta and gammas range and shoot him with alphas. It will be tough but you can win this match-up with some strong aim and positioning.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Going in the air can midagate everything Tech Shoto does, but if he's indoors it's better to not even try to fight him unless you already know he's super weak. When indoors against him simply keep yourself grounded and prepared to roll his beta's explosion. Combos won't often work against him since his alpha's ice will interrupt them most of the time.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Froppy has no way to beat you when you simply use alpha to catch her mobility or when you're too far away, and beta to punish her own betas. However, Froppy won't often face you in an even fight so be prepared to fight one off whenever you see one by keeping yourself as high health as the team fight allows to avoid a sneaky Froppy striking the moment you find yourself vulnerable.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
When kirishima gets close it can be quite hard to escape him without taking large amounts of damage, since your own wake-up options are quite bad. However, his alpha, beta and gamma all have openings to punish with alpha, so if he somehow gets close to you then knocking him down with 2 alphas is the best and only way to escape reliably.  Simply beat him by spamming alpha to make sure he never gets close and you'll win every time.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Strike Kirishima is able to punish every option you have very heavily, with either his rock to punish being in the air from your gamma or using beta -> alpha -> gamma to punish your beta. That said his gamma does have a window to shoot him with alphas, but if the Kirishima has Hardening up he's usually trading 100 DMG taken for 250 dealt, so even this is bad to do consistently. If you're close enough your gamma goes through his beta shield, but if he's smart he will let go of beta when you get that close and punish you for trying. You can contribute in the fight against one by punishing his gamma and beta with your alpha, but if these are aimed at you then you're probably screwed.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Denki is another beamer that you win against in the alpha trade department. Your beta is also fantastic at catching his wakeup since his mobility tool has a bad startup. Just be cautious that he doesn't punish you with a gamma, since if he does you will die, so if he doesn't burn his i-frames and get caught by the beta, then you can beta cancel in the direction of the Denki and gamma to avoid a free stun on his part by either using gamma as a wall or by damaging him with it.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This match-up is largely dependent on the situation. Your alpha is great at catching his slow gamma start-up and beta, but he's also great at punishing you with his own beta into alpha spam. You can catch his wake-up rather easily with your beta however. If he's super far away just try to stay near cover to break his line of sight.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
If momo gets close, it can be hard to escape her, but if you simply treat her like Assault Kirishima and never let her get close, you will win. That said her beta dash makes for a much better way to close the gap than Assault Kirishima does, and if she gets close she will be able to keep you still and prevent your escape with her alpha or gamma. Never fight one in doors and play cautiously against one.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
You lose if the monoma has good abilities but it's so hard to know what abilities he will have, hence, the match-up doesn't have a fixed difficulty. That said, just hit your alphas. Anything else is too risky to go for, given his kit and especially his gamma.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Just play and keep yourself away with gamma and alpha, she won't be able to touch you. She can catch you off guard and do large amounts of damage with her alpha and gamma though. If she's holding her beta out then just spam it with some high level alphas or get closer and use gamma to hit underneath the shield depending on range. Overall just stay far away and use height to your advantage.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
She doesn't really have many windows outside of alpha to hit her, and if you do hit her she just charges her beta and erases you. If the player knows what they're doing, you will lose this match-up almost every time.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ibara is one of the few characters that will out-stat you. Her melee moves will deal more DMG than you, and so applies to her alpha as well. However, every skill she does forces a pause on her motion. You can let her lock on a teammate and punish her with alphas. If she locks onto you then punish every missed shot the best you can and stay away from her. If her aim isn't perfect you should win for free, but even if she hits every shot you'll be a super valuable asset to keeping her in check and preventing her from annihilating you and your team with those high DMG alphas.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
If you can roll, this matchup shouldn't be a issue. Simply roll any attempts the enemy makes of landing a beta and punish it with a beta combo of your own or alphas. Keep in mind your gamma hits through his gamma and can catch Mirios off-guard while you delete their health with a combo.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Tamaki is a grapple character and by defalt this makes him quite hard to deal with. However, if you can get used to his special and beta momentum you should be able to catch one with alphas. This is another character very prone to wake-up catches with beta too, and if he tries to use his gamma you can also punish this very easily from long range. Be weary of grapple and you should be fine.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Nejire is another character prone to wake-up catches with beta, but you'll rarely ever need to do this. Alphas beats everything she can do very easily, and even if your aim isn't perfect she still can't outdamage you consistently. However, unless you're going for a wake-up catch, never use beta offensively against her. She can simply jump over it and then punish you, so stick to alphas and the occasional beta wake-up catch.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Shinso has a lot of "lag" on his moves, so you can punish with your alpha any of his options. He's also very prone to wake-up catches with his lack of good wake-up options so catch that weakness. Keep in mind that he can explode your health super fast too and should be taken seriously, but if you fight him with your team you should be able to take him down by punishing his attempts to grab or brainwash with your alpha.
<br>

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Assault All Might has a lot of "laggy" options perfect for punishing with alphas. However his gamma makes quite a good wake-up option, so catching it might be hard, but if you time it right you should still be able to catch his gamma. Just beat him with alphas and there's little he can do to win the alpha trade. If he hits you with beta, wake and then do nothing. You'll take a lot of damage but if he tries to go for another beta he will fly by you allowing you to even the score, and if he doesn't you'll be able to mixup when you go for alpha alpha to knock him back.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Rapid All Might's alpha and beta are both very "laggy" and keep him quite still, allowing you to pile on alphas. Rapid All Might's alpha even reduces the down power he takes so you can shoot 3 full alphas before he gets knocked back. His beta is also very predictable for movement so catch that with alphas. Be weary of the suplex as it can catch you very easily for high amounts of damage if you go into the air. Stay grounded, knock him down with alphas, and go in for the wake-up catch to finish the job.
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Aizawa will be able to punish you very hard for almost everything you do, but just keep in mind that if he's comboing a teamate, two clean shots will knock him out of the combo early, and to top it off he might be one of the most prone to wake-up catches in the game so he can't really challenge your beta on wake-up well. If Aizawa goes for alpha pull, melee 1, gamma (which is a common strategy) then spam air melee. You should be able to break the combo on GP after the melee.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Present Mic just out-damages and out-ranges you. Focus on keeping his boomboxes destroyed and don't get close since his beta is very dangerous from up close. Mic can be a easy target for wake-up catches but it can be hard to be in the sweetspot to catch his wake-up due to the worry about his beta, so just stick to alphas here.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Your gamma allows you to easily line up and go over everything Cementoss builds and catch him with alphas. He can't really injure air targets so just be in the air as much as you can or at least above him on a building, and punish attempts to build up with alphas or a beta. Be weary that going for beta will often trade with his alpha's lingering hitbox, so alphas will often be better.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endevor is capable of out-maneuvering you quite efficiently with his special action and beta. Additionally, his beta is among the only moves in the game capable of winning alpha trades against Full Bullet and simultaneously is a great combo breaker if you try to catch his wake-up in any situation. Your advantage is that he's a big target for alphas and often leaves himself open for shots with his gamma and special action. Be weary of the enemy having Space Hop as thats super common on Endevor. 
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Endeavor lost the match-up-defining beta that Strike Endeavor has, but his Assault counterpart has gained strong aerial tools to attack grounded enemies, which results in large damage against you if he gets to jump you or if you miss a key hit. That said Assault Endeavor leaves himself open a lot, with his beta, gamma, and special action all being quite "laggy" which leads to you being able to alpha spam him quite well. Once again be weary of Space Hop.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Hawks can stay quite far from you and is among the part of the cast that wake-up catches with beta often don't work on. However, there is little Hawks can do to beat out your alphas. He also has openings to shoot him if he tries to shoot a gamma or use beta for mobility, since both of those skills have solid "lag" on them. If your aim is strong and you're goot at dodging, then there should be no issues here.
<br>

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
All she has going for her is Giant Mode, but with the recent cooldowm changes even this is rarely that threatening. Her damage in close range is okay, but you can easily outmaneuver her and win even in melee range. Try to stall for time when she grows big by using your I-frames effectively and rolling when needed and you should have no issues. She's not a threat anymore in small mode and while you always won againsy small mode anyways, now she just can't fight back.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Shigaraki is able to punish you for touching the ground quite well with his gamma and additionally can be quite a slippery target when piloted by a good player, but there's a few key issues here, being that Strike Shigaraki has no options against you when you are in the air, and while you are in the beta animation you are not considered to be on the ground when it comes to receiving damage from his alpha and beta. This means that a beta, beta cancel, gamma with 2 Shigaraki alphas underneath you will often only result in 4 ticks of damage maximum, and sometimes lower. That said, never fight Shigaraki indoors without a good reason to. If you're going indoors with him you better have a massive HP lead or you're gonna be in for a tough time.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Assault Shigaraki has the same issue of being unable to hit you in the air, but Assault Shigaraki doesn't suffer from hitting you during your beta animation with his alpha. When fighting Shigaraki try to be in the air or above him in some way and catch his openings with your alpha or beta. He leaves himself really vulnerable when using beta, gamma tap, and to a lesser extent alpha and special action. Be weary of the explosive combos Assault Shigaraki has and you should have no issues. This character is also very prone to wake-up catches with your beta.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
In a 1v1 situation it's closer to even, but the simple fact that you can very easily interrupt any combos he goes for with your alpha if he misses gamma means you shut down AFO in a team fight. His charge alpha, beta, gamma, and special action steal all have enough "lag" to punish him strongly. Keep yourself grounded and avaliable to roll his gamma or if you are in the air then shoot him twice during the pull animation to prevent the pull from happening. Be weary of wall pierce beta and don't try to approch him while he's standing as his beta acts as a keep away tool Full Bullet can't compete with.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
The main issue here is that Tech Dabi disrupts your armorless options quite well, and alpha spam against him is also iffy with his traps and gamma blocking them. When Tech Dabi is close to you it can often be surprisingly hard to create space, as his gamma is a fantastic tool for interrupting your gammas and betas. Fortunately, you can kinda often forget about his existence as he doesn't really pose a threat from range, and can't break that gap easily. If you gamma up you can often ignore his gamma wall and shoot him from above, but Tech Dabi is most often found in buildings where this isn't a option or even if he is outdoors, his beta still blocks your alpha. Keep a eye for Wall Runner on dabis too as they very often carry this special tune.

Strike Dabi trades all the defensive utility for offense, but there are many issues with it. Strike Dabi has gained the ability to fight you from a distance, but fortunately he's bad at it, leaving himself perfectly still for some shots, allowing you to easily and consistently win the alpha trade. Strike Dabi's beta also doesn't have much armor until the grab happens, so if he approches. you can jump beta him away. His gamma also leaves him quite open during activation and makes him probably the most prone to wake-up catches in the game since when his gamma hits 0 while he's knocked back, he will be forced to start the burst as soon as he gets back up so he can't be smart with his invincibility frames most of the time. Some well aimed shots and a beta or 2 should take a Strike Dabi down easily.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tech Toga is yet another character with a bad wake-up game, so she can't really compete with Full Bullet's wake-up catches, meaning that in close range she's quite vulnerable. In range, you have better damage than she does and the range difference often doesn’t matter. Some good clean shots to punish attemps to transform or run away will catch her quite well, and in close range she can't really compete.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Toga can dish out very high burst damage with beta alpha gamma combo, but you can do the same with some alphas so this match-up often comes down to the first hit. Rapid Toga is okay against wake-up catches due to how fast her gamma is but she's extremely bad at disengaging against you since your alpha very easily catches her gamma's endlag, preventing her escape.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Ever since Twice lost his combos, he has since been unable to put up a good fight against anyone. He leaves himself quite open to alphas with Twice's gamma and beta "lag". The only time where you should struggle with Twice is when he has a lot of clones, but even then your beta is capable of hitting multiple clones at once and dealing with them quite efficiently.

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Mr. Compress has one of the worst wake-up games out of the cast so catching his wake-up should be easy if you get close to him. However, Compress is very hard to get close to, so you'll be relying on alpha for this one. If Compress reflects your alpha it will reflect as the spread shot rather than the aimed shot, so he will often only reflect 2-3 pellets rather than the full shot. Compress also can't fire at you if he's holding beta, and if he holds it all the time just get closer and threaten with your own beta. Mr. Compress can melt you quickly with alpha staggers, but you can also mess him up with some well aimed alphas amd a beta to catch wake-ups.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Overhaul is very threatening up close because his gamma beats out all your moves up close. You do have significantly more alpha damage, but the main issue here is the gamma. An Overhaul that's good with gamma can prevent you from ever escaping since it also hits and stuns through your wall. Overhaul can also heal himself, which makes this match-up even weirder. Overhaul isn't prone to wake-up catches, and in fact, he catches your wake-ups very easily. Against Overhaul just try to stay farther away from higher ground and win alpha trades, as if he gets too close it can be quite hard to escape.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri is able to alpha trade with you, and has some very high damage combos with his beta that he goes for a lot. Kurogiri is also very good at keeping you far away from him, so while his ability to prevent the wake-up catch is bad, it doesn't matter if you never get close enough to begin with. For this match-up it's strongly recommended targeting him first in a team fight due to his revive capability.
