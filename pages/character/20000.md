The Symbol of Peace is BACK with a new arsenal inspired by his beloved Class 1-A! From beaming, combos, mobility, the Symbol of Peace is back to steal the spotlight! 

Armored All Might is a mid/close ranged fighter that is incredibly versatile and literally has something for every situation. Use alpha to fight from afar, beta for burst damage and combo setups, and gamma to protect yourself even when you’re getting hit!

## Alpha Skill - Ice Bullet Shot/Flame Bullet Shot

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br> <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique1_2.png" width="400" />
</p>

Armored All Might’s alpha has two different versions depending on whether or not you’re in Aim Mode. If you’re in Aim Mode you’ll use Flame Bullet Shot and if you’re not in Aim Mode you’ll use Ice Bullet Shot. While using alpha you can hold down the alpha input and it’ll fire at a faster rate unlike other alphas where you have to keep pressing the input to fire multiple shots. Both versions are used for different things so let’s start with Ice Bullet Shot.


### Ice Bullet Shot</br>
Ice Bullet Shot is a low damage alpha that is capable of freezing an enemy after 3 shots are landed on the same target and the freeze is comparable to Strike Todoroki’s gamma. This version of alpha is only really used as a combo starter as its damage is pretty low. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200a-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

### Flame Bullet Shot</br>
Now this version of alpha is the one you’ll most likely be using a lot more. It does good damage and then 70 true damage over time doing 10 burn damage per tick with 7 ticks. This version of alpha has multiple uses like beaming and ending combos. The 70 true damage is present no matter the level of alpha so it’s very good at weakening foes for your teammates. A common technique to help mitigate the slower camera from Aim Mode is to aim in unaimed mode first, then use Aim Mode to use Flame Bullet Shot so you retain your faster camera while still having access to firing Flame Bullet Shot.

## Beta Skill - Blackwhip Charge Bolt/Blackwhip Cellophane
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br><img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch200_Unique2_2.png" width="400" />
</p>

Beta is versatile but not quite as versatile as Drone Anima. It is a very potent burst damage, mobility, and combo starter tool that you should definitely keep your eye on the cooldown for as you’ll be using beta a ton. From now on I will be referring to Blackwhip Charge Bolt as Blackbolt and Blackwhip Cellophane as Blackphane for brevity sake.

### Blackwhip Charge Bolt</br>
Blackbolt is a very good burst damage option that locks an opponent in place for the entirety of its time doing damage which is incredibly powerful for teammates with low down power moves so they can pile on extra damage. This Quirk Skill is also really good as a combo ender as its good damage can make some combos do much more damage and possibly even down from 400 HP without tuning. Using Blackbolt does keep YOU in place as well if you manage to hit someone with it so keep that in mind when using it in a crowded area where other players can get cheap shots on you. This version of beta can only be used while you’re on the ground and does NOT pull you towards opponents or the environment like Blackphane does. While using Blackbolt you can cancel the animation with a grounded melee.

</p>

### Blackwhip Cellophane</br>
Blackphane is where his utility starts getting better. Blackphane will pull you towards wherever it hits whether it be the environment or other players letting you use Blackphane for mobility or as a combo starter. There is also a special hit box when using Blackphane that is only present when one of these two scenarios occur:

- You use Blackphane on the environment and run into a foe
- You use Blackphane on a foe and you are positioned directly above or under them

This special hit box will be referred to as an “air bash” from now on. While using Blackphane you can cancel the movement with a beta input which has some niche uses in combos but is also good if you need to prematurely stop during Blackphane’s mobility.

## Gamma Skill - Drone Anima
<p align="center">

</p>
Drone Anima is his best Quirk Skill by far and it’s not even close. Drone Anima is a combo breaker, combo starter, extra damage output during combos, a way to perform fly by attacks with tracking projectiles, a 100 damage burst option, and it staggers after 2 drones even on GP. It definitely has a lot going for it and should always be out 24/7 no matter what unless you are trying to hide as the drones can give you away. As for how it actually works you press gamma once and he will summon drones that follow him and aim towards where his camera is looking and will track onto the person closest to the center of your screen. You can either tap gamma to fire one drone or hold gamma to fire all remaining drones all at once. Once his gamma reaches 0% all remaining drones will automatically be fired wherever his camera is facing. You can also fire drones during your own actions like in the middle of firing an alpha or opening an Item Box for example. The damage on the drones does not increase on level ups so it is a consistent 100 damage option once gamma reaches level 4. The drones do have some tracking but it isn’t anything crazy so don’t expect them to make crazy turns around corners to hit someone. A very strong aspect of the drones is you can shoot them out even when you are taking damage meaning you can shoot out two drones to stagger the enemy and interrupt their combo. You only need two drones to stagger an enemy even if they are on GP and that stagger is great for breaking out of combos like previously mentioned and for starting combos. It is highly recommended to get gamma to level 4 first no matter what kind of play style you have so you can have 4 drones instead of 3 enabling you to stagger opponents twice per gamma activation instead of just once. An important thing to note is you cannot shoot drones the moment you are put into i-frames and must wait a bit after you are put into i-frames before you are able to shoot drones again. This also happens if you are put into heavy hit stun like getting hit by Tamaki Amajiki's gamma. Another drawback of gamma is that once you activate it you are put into a long start-up animation where enemies can easily attack you for free so try to activate Drone Anima behind cover before starting your onslaught.

## Special Action - Thruster Uravity/Thruster Ingenium
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch200/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch200.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Special Action is an insane movement option that gives him the ability to catch up with even the fastest characters in the game or fly up into the air to completely counter some characters who struggle with aerial threats. Thruster Uravity is used when Armored All Might goes up with his Special Action while Thruster Ingenium is used when Armored All Might goes forward with his Special Action.
</p>

### Thruster Uravity</br>
Pressing the jump input in the air activates Thruster Uravity and you can choose to hold jump to continue gaining height or tap jump to hover similarly to Nejire and Endeavor. You can reach some insane heights by holding jump with max Special Action to the point where you very easily reach the skybox or at least get very close to it. Holding jump does take a decent amount of Special Action if you do decide to hold it so keep that in mind when managing your Special Action. The hover version doesn’t take that much Special Action per tick so you can hover for quite a while which lets you like stated before keep in the air so you can counter enemies who thrive on the ground but struggle facing aerial foes. Using Thruster Uravity does not end your invincibility frames early and is an amazing wake up option as you gain height so fast it’s hard for characters to punish you after your invincibility frames are over. Even characters with big AOEs like All For One with his gamma have trouble catching you if you use Thruster Uravity on wake up.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Thruster Ingenium</br>
This version of Special Action will have you zipping around the map at ludicrous speeds. Like Thruster Uravity there are two ways to use this version of Special Action and that is by either tapping or holding Special Action respectively and both of these versions can be used both in the air and on the ground. By tapping Special Action you get a burst of speed where Armored All Might is facing and it takes 20% of his Special Action. The hold version makes him perform a longer dash that covers a great distance and takes 80% of his Special Action. Do note that you can perform either of these even if you only have 1% of his Special Action. When using the hold version of Special Action you can cancel the dash early by pressing Special Action again or using a melee, and when using the tap version of Special Action you can cancel it early by using a melee. Do note that using Thruster Ingenium ends your invincibility frames early so it is not advised to use it on wake up.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
### Ground Melee</br>
A two hit string that starts with a punch propelling Armored All Might forward and ends with an explosion that knocks the opponent back far from where the punch started. This melee has some tracking to it and the explosion hit is very good at catching wake ups due to its delayed hit box. It is possible to combo the first hit of grounded melee into itself once and then do the explosion hit for extra damage. The grounded melee also has a degree of movement you can perform with it by holding a direction after you start a Melee 1. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

## Air Melee <br>
The character is the first one to have a three hit air melee string and he makes VERY good use of it. Air melee can be used as a combo starter if coming in with your Special Action and is a main proponent in many of his combos. The first and last hit of his air melee string propels Armored All Might forward which isn’t particularly useful but still good to keep in mind just in case.

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
A path that lets you spam alphas as soon as possible. Gamma 4 because the fourth drone is too good with its utility, alpha 9 for alpha’s max effectiveness early, beta 4 so you can reposition with its increased range, gamma 9 to aid gamma’s utility, and beta 9 last since if you’re beaming from the sky you probably aren’t going to be using beta for damage much.

</p>

### Balanced Path
A balanced path that makes him better able to handle all situations with more alpha damage early letting him fare better against distant enemies compared to the Combo Path. Gamma 4 because gamma's utility is amazing, beta 4 for the range increase so you can reposition better, and alpha 4 for the gauge consumption reduction and size increase. Beta 9 lets you reposition more often and gives him his very nice burst damage, gamma 9 so your drones are out longer, and alpha 9 so you can bring out your full ranged power.

</p>

### Combo Path
A very combo oriented path that enables his high damage grounded beta finishers early. Gamma 4 gets him his fourth drone which is invaluable and beta 9 increases his mobility and damage greatly so he can get in close and do some damage. Alpha 4 is before gamma 9 because alpha also does good damage and the freeze is a good combo starter if you can land it and is more impactful than gamma 9. Gamma 9 is before alpha 9 however because the increase in time the drones can be out is incredibly good and the reload speed increase at level 9 is also very appreciated.

</p>

### Why is Gamma Lvl.9 always recommended second to last?
Gamma level 9's increase in time the drones can be out makes unable to be combo'd for even longer than level 4, which increases his survivability greatly.It also lets you have a great combo starter up for even longer.

## Techs
### Thruster Boost
A nice way to get some extra distance out of Thruster Ingenium via melee cancelling. All it is is at the end of either your tap or hold version of Special Action you do a grounded Melee 1 since grounded Melee 1 propels Armored All Might a good distance. You can also take advantage of the degree of control you get after Melee 1 with this tech. Doing this tech with an air melee isn't as good since you don't go nearly as far as a grounded melee. Both air and grounded melee can be used to cancel your tap Special Action early in case you need to stop for whatever reason just make sure that if it's the grounded melee to also turn to the side so you can avoid going forward.

</p>

### Rejuvinating Flight
A niche thing you can do is start drinking a healing item, drop off a ledge, and then tap/hold jump to fly while continuing your drinking. This does not apply to Thruster Ingenium. This tech won't get used very often, but if you spot someone like an Assault Kendo running towards you you can perform this tech to prevent her from cancelling your healing and strike back after the healing is done.

</p>
        
## Combos
These are different ways you can squeeze as much damage as possible out of Armored All Might’s entire move set while conforming to the 500 down power (DP) restriction. The down power of each of Armored All Might’s moves are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill - 

Ice Bullet Shot - 50<br>
Flame Bullet Shot - 125
<br>

Beta Skill -

Blackbolt’s Grab - 100<br>
Blackbolt’s Continuous Damage - 0<br>
Blackbolt’s Finishing Throw - 500

Blackphane’s Grab - 200<br>
Blackphane’s Air Bash - 100
<br>

Gamma Skill - 90 per drone
<br>

Ground Melee 1 - 200<br>
Ground Melee 2 - 300
<br>

Air Melee 1 - 50<br>
Air Melee 2 - 50<br>
Air Melee 3 - 400
<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

Since Armored All Might’s drones can be activated mid-action if a drone(s) can be used in a combo for extra damage without needing to be used at a specific point in the combo an extra parameter will be present above the combo listing the max amount of drones you can use for extra damage without breaking the combo. The damage calculation will be calculated assuming you used the max number of extra damage drones listed. 

For combos that require an additional stun with gamma if performed on GP shoot drones a half-second after the Air Melee 2 and if performed on HP wait until Armored All Might slides past the enemy and then shoot the drones. If you mistime the drones the enemy will not get staggered again and they can break out of the combo easier.


### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Melee 1 -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2

A basic combo that you can do if you manage to land a raw Melee 1 on someone though the timing on the second Melee 1 is tight if you want it to be true on GP.

</p>

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)</a>

A combo you can perform on an enemy you hit a Blackphane on directly above them to get the air bash hit box.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Blackbolt -> Gamma (hold)

Another basic combo that sacrifices all of your drones for good burst damage. You can alternatively use your drones to stagger first and then hit the Blackbolt.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Blackbolt -> Gamma 2x -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2

A combo that you can use when close to an opponent and land a Blackbolt as your first move. This combo utilizes cancelling the Blackbolt early with a grounded melee for extra damage compared to the previous combo. Make sure you are using your Melee 1 on the last possible damage tick of Blackbolt for maximum damage which with no tuning would be 80 damage. With the drones it would become 130 before you melee because 80 + 50 = 130.

</p>

### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) 

A useful combo to know for when you hit a Blackphane on a grounded enemy. Make sure you are only doing the Gamma 2x after the two air melees so you can keep the enemy staggered to confirm the Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot).

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">Air Melee 1</a> -> Air Melee 2 -> Air Melee 3

A solid air combo that you can perform on aerial foes hit with Blackphane. Armored All Might’s air melee tracking is a bit strange so this combo will sometimes miss the enemy even if your camera is turned to face them.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a>

An untrue, but more damaging combo you can perform on a grounded enemy you hit with Blackphane. The Blackbolt becomes more consistent with the help of Acceleration or Rapid Ability Cards. Since this combo is untrue it is not recommended to use this combo on someone like Mirio or other characters with quick combo breaker options unless you have a way to hasten your attack speed.

</p>

### Blackphane (On environment) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 ->  Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A situational combo that you won’t be hitting much, but if you run into someone on the ground while using Blackphane for movement you can perform this combo on them. The air melee problem is also present here so this combo isn’t the most consistent. Also make sure that you are pressing the beta input again after the air bash connects so you can perform the air melees as failing to do so will just keep moving Armored All Might past the enemy.

</p>

### Extra Damage Drones: 2
### Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A combo you can use while grounded or in the air and manage to freeze someone. The hardest part about the combo is landing the freeze as some characters can easily evade your alphas but once the enemy is frozen it’s a free guard break for you. If you want to guarantee the freeze shoot the two drones out first to stagger the enemy and that buys you enough time to get the three Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot)s off.

<p align="center">

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackbolt -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a> -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A combo with tight timing that heavily utilizes the melee cancel that can be performed during Blackbolt. Make sure to time your melee cancel after your Blackbolt has done 80 damage (without tuning) as that is the last tick of damage before it sends the enemy into a hard knock down. Becomes more consistent with attack speed increases. The Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot) is true, but since it does not hard knock down the enemy can attack you during it if they react fast enough.

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Blackphane (On enemy) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Air Melee 3

A combo to use when you hit a Blackphane directly under an opponent to utilize the air bash property of Blackphane.

## Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Blackbolt -> Gamma 2x

A combo that does better damage than the previous freeze combo but requires you to be grounded when the freeze happens unlike the previous freeze one. It is recommended to hit the Blackbolt first instead of trying to hit the drones first so you can guarantee all the damage as if you try to do the drones first you might be too slow and miss the Blackbolt. Alternatively you can shoot out the two gammas before the Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot)s to confirm the freeze.

<p align="center">

</p>

## Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> Gamma 2x -> Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot)

A true version of the next freeze combo that does less damage. Good if you want to confirm damage with no fear of the enemy breaking out. The clause of the freeze being tricky to apply applies here too. You can again shoot the two gammas early to confirm the freeze.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/200c13-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Blackphane (On environment) -> Air Bash -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 ->  Gamma 2x -> Blackbolt

A more damaging version of the combo mentioned previously that instead ends with Blackbolt instead of Alpha (Flame Bullet Shot). The same issues of the combo being situational, the air melee having weird tracking, and needing to press the beta input again when the air bash connects all apply here too. This combo is not recommended to be performed when the foe’s allies are nearby as they will punish you during your Blackbolt animation.

<p align="center">

### Extra Damage Drones: 1
### Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot) -> Air Melee 1 -> Air Melee 2 -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">Blackbolt</a>

An untrue, but very punishing combo if you manage to land a freeze on a grounded enemy and are close to them. Again, only recommended to perform this combo if you have a way to quicken your attack speed.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>This tuning like all melee tunings on this character is incredibly easy to activate and makes him a combo demon. The extra movement speed is a nice bonus but you’re mainly using this tuning to make his combos harder to escape from as the more damaging ones are untrue.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Embrittlement is basically a free 10% damage increase on the target due to how easy it is to land melees and how much he melees in his combos.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br> If you have trouble tracking enemies Perception combined with this character’s movement almost ensures that you’ll be able to catch up to them and finish them off.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch016_00.png" width="125"> | **Special Attack Reload Boost** <br>This character’s main mobility comes from Special Action so having a way to have it basically always up for a bit after inflicting a DOWN is invaluable. This tune also allows you to use your hold Special Action on the ground and regain Special Action at the same time.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>Basically a get out of jail free card whenever your guard is broken. You can use this time to fly into the air and then dash away to safety. Attacking will end the Permeation early and if you’re fast enough with inputs you can drink a small GP or HP or even a big GP drink if the attack that guard broke you was not a knock down.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>When you guard break someone ALL your cooldowns get a very nice reload boost which helps keep his beta, gamma, and Special Action off cooldown which is very strong. The preference for Special Attack Reload Boost and Quirk Factor Release depends on whether or not you want a ludicrously fast Special Action reload speed or a decently fast reload speed on all your abilities.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder** <br>This character’s movement is disgusting to the point where you’re most likely reaching Kota before the rest of the lobby even has a chance to get close, letting you and your team get a free +3 levels to all your Quirk Skills.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Armored All Might has no problem fighting early so this tune lets him level up quickly for an early power spike. Once you’re max level you can give your extra level cards to teammates and once their max you can level up your Ability Cards.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Essentially an extra life which is huge on a character that can get away from situations very easily.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>20% Plus Ultra charge on every KO lets Armored All Might snowball the entire match since he has more than enough damage and utility to consistently KO opponents the entire match.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_02.png" width="125"> | **Hyper Regeneration** <br>Armored All Might can guard break very easily which means he’ll be constantly healing both HP and GP passively during a fight. A really nice tune if you’re especially aggressive since it can let you stay in fights longer before needing to heal.|

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Izuku doesn’t really have anything too threatening to use against you. You can fly out of his beta range, Blackwhip is hard to land, and alpha while being his best Quirk Skill can’t do much if it’s the only thing he can use to attack you with. Just out beam him or use tricky movement if you’re close to avoid his damage and land your combos on him.
<br>
## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Full Bullet’s alpha is much more powerful than Assault Izuku’s, but that’s all he has going for him if you’re in the air. Full Bullet’s beta is incredibly inconsistent to land on aerial enemies and gamma can only really be used to match your height. You can’t really out beam a character who can do 200 damage with two alphas however, and getting close to him makes you liable to getting combo’d, so this a battle where if you can’t go higher than his alpha’s range and fire back at him you must get close and bait his beta and gamma so you can perform your own combos on him. Drone Anima can also be used to prevent his beta from doing massive damage if you use it before Full Bullet’s beta connects onto the ground.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This is a fight where whoever lands the most combos wins. Izuku using the apex of One For All is fast, hard to hit, and has very annoying to deal with attacks. Thankfully, Drone Anima can be used to make this pest sit in place for you to wallop him. He also has very punishable end lag after he uses beta so if you can either roll and punish or go up into the air and punish if he uses Quintuple. He also has some start up whenever he uses gamma and if you roll his lock on correctly that’s another free punish for you. However, this is all assuming he hasn’t gotten the chance to rush you down as once that happens you’re in for a rough time unless you have your drones ready and waiting. A weird property Drone Anima has with Izuku’s lock on gamma is if you tap the drones when hit by his gamma the drones will not shoot out but if you HOLD the drones they will shoot out. TLDR: Hold gamma when One For All Deku hits you with his gamma to stagger him out of the punch and you’ll avoid a big chunk of damage.

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Bakugo can’t really do much to you once you’re in the air. His beta is incredibly hard to land on aerial enemies and Bakugo has to spend his precious Special Action to match your height to use gamma. The thing is, you can just use tap Special Action or go higher to get out of range of gamma. As long as you keep your distance and don’t let him get the jump on you this fight should be a cinch.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Machine Gun is an entirely different beast however. He is incredibly fast, evasive, and does really solid damage. Unless you are incredibly accurate with your aim this character will be a massive headache as trying to kill a mosquito that can delete fair amounts of your health bar relatively quickly is not a fight you’d want to take in general if possible. Best thing you can do against Machine Gun is punish his gamma end lag and get as much damage as possible then. Drone Anima is also a decent way to get him to sit still for you and could turn the fight around as his low HP makes your combos even more devastating against him. Problem is with using your drones however is Machine Gun is incredibly fast and depending on his speed and your angle on him hitting drones on him could prove to be challenging. If Machine Gun decides to try and trade alphas with you you barely win the trade so a better option would be to take the chance to stagger him with drones and combo him off the stagger.

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Another mosquito that can delete your health except she can do it even faster if she lands a gamma on you. Thankfully, she has decent end lag at the end of her beta and gamma so punish those moves if she misses them. Try to stay off the floor as much as possible as getting hit by Ochaco’s gamma is a very easy way to lose the fight right then and there. There’s enough end lag to get a freeze off on her if you can evade her gamma which is a very good way to get some damage on her as Armored All Might’s freeze combos are his deadliest but the timing is pretty tight. Your drones are another massive asset you have against Ochaco to keep her in place but depending on how fast she’s moving and your angle to her she could dodge the drones using her crazy mobility. A key part of surviving her if you do get hit by her gamma is to stagger her with your drones as this will buy you enough time move out of her gamma and either continue fighting her or run away.
<br>


## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Zero Satellites does have a very hard hitting charged alpha, but she can’t really do much to you if you keep your distance. Her regular alpha is a slow moving projectile you can get out of the way of, beta can be some trouble but nothing your drones can’t stun her out of, and her gamma  is only threatening if you’re on the ground. Don’t worry about her using her charge gamma to heal as you have more than enough mobility to catch her up there. Just keep in mind that if you get close she does have a charged alpha that can do some decent damage on you.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Iida if you let him get the jump on you can be really oppressive and hard to shake off. Depending on how good the Iida’s movement is, landing drones on him could prove to be difficult, but getting some height on him forces him to use some alphas and betas to match your height which gets rid of some of his pressure. Once his Recipro runs out that’s when you want to rain the pain on him as he is incredibly vulnerable in this state. This fight revolves around whether or not you can survive under pressure if he gets the jump on you and if you get the jump on him how long you can pressure him with beta and gamma to keep him in place for you and your team. Do keep in mind that Iida has armor on his beta meaning your drones cannot stagger him out of it so whenever Iida goes for a beta focus on dodging it instead of staggering him out of it.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Todoroki’s two most threatening moves in beta and gamma are stuck to being grounded moves meaning that staying in the air is the play to shut him down. If he tries to bait you into a building it is generally not worth the risk of following him as this character can absolutely eviscerate you if he’s in a small space with you.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ice Fang Wind Flame has the same counterplay as Strike Todoroki with the addition of never following this version into a building as he’s even more of a menace inside small spaces than Strike Todoroki unless you know he’s beaten and battered. Ice Fang Wind Flame can also hide inside of the fire pillars spawned by his gamma if he doesn’t want to risk getting hit by your alphas or drones, but this isn’t generally an issue as he also can’t really do much to you in this state because he has to keep spamming gammas if he wants to keep the tornadoes up. 
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Tsuyu is a slippery foe, but drones can usually shut down her tricky movement. If you see her trying to get a beta on you while you’re in the air try to dash out of the range of her beta with Special Action and punish with a beta of your own. On the ground it's the same idea except you can just dodge roll instead of dashing with Special Action. It’s easier to get the beta off if you stun with drones first as her end lag on beta isn’t the slowest but it gives you enough time to get something going. If you do get hit by her beta you can simply fire back with drones and use your own beta on her as a punish.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Stay in the air and this guy can do literally nothing to you. If you HAVE to fight him up close however try to bait his alpha and beta by rolling behind him and punishing the end lag, and for gamma get some height to avoid the lingering hit box as the hit box lingers for quite a while. Blackbolt can keep Kirishima in place even while he’s Hardened which can help in case you need a breather from his beta spam in a closed space. Do keep in mind that while Kirishima has Hardening active your drones cannot stagger him easily so don't rely on them too much for staggers during this fight.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Red Drive can do ludicrous amounts of damage in a ludicrously short amount of time and has the tools to follow you if you don’t use your entire arsenal to get away from him. Red Drive’s alpha lets him get some decent movement and is a combo starter, his beta is an incredibly annoying shield and massive AOE damage if you’re on the ground, and his gamma has him throw a rock that has a stupidly long lingering hit box, does good damage, knocks you down in two hits, and Red Drive is armored during the throw. There’s not really a reliable way to stun him as his shield is very good, he attacks fast, has insane movement that can make it hard for your drones or beta to connect, and Hardening makes your drones have a much harder time staggering him. He does have an opening when he uses his gamma so if you can capitalize on that that can get you some nice damage unless he has Hardening active This is a rough fight whether you’re in or outdoors and you should not take this foe lightly.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Flying into the air makes Momo absolutely defenseless against you so if you catch her out in an open area she is positively screwed just rain down alphas on her and she’ll be dead. It is ill-advised to follow her inside of a building unless she is almost dead as this is where Momo thrives since her cannons are very good deterrents and she can use her shields to block off entrances and exits to keep you trapped if she’s smart enough.  
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Same deal as most other characters just fly up and most of his damage is gone. As always when fighting Denki be careful fighting close quarters against him as one mis-timed roll can lead to deadly damage on you. Denki’s Special Action makes it harder for you to perform combos where you have to be close to him to perform them but you can perform proper spacing with alpha and gamma to take him down. 
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Lightning has almost every tool to deal with you. Want to get in close for combos? Mines and Special Action. Want to beam him from out of the sky? He can beam you right back. Want to run away using your Special Action or beta? If there’s no line of sight blockers he’s got you in his sights. His mines can also block your drones which makes it even harder to get in and start something against him. Your best bet is to start attacking him before he notices that you’re getting close otherwise it’ll be hard to get in against Lightning. Thankfully, if Lightning does not have his Special Action up he shoots alphas much slower, and if he does have Special Action up he'll only be able to get one or two fully charged alphas off before your alphas knock him down.

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
The unpredictability of Monoma makes it hard to determine whether or not he’s a threat to you, but Armored All Might is incredibly versatile and can handle most of the tricks he has up his sleeves. If he tries running you have the mobility to chase him down so this fight is more you keeping track of what Quirks he’s Copied so you can plan your strategy accordingly.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kendo is absolutely screwed as soon as you enter the sky as the only thing she can do is hold her shield up and look for cover. If you must fight Kendo in a close-quarters environment then stay out of melee range with tap Special Action and beta and try to bait out gamma so you can punish with your combos.

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Twin Palm Strike has just as many combos as you do and the mobility to catch up with you if you don’t have Special Action to run away with. Her alpha can make it incredibly annoying to get in or out but you do have drones to cover that option and you can punish with alpha if she misses, her beta can be a problem if you don’t have beta off cooldown to kick her out of it so don’t use beta recklessly against her as doing so will rid you of your option against her beta. Gamma is too fast moving for the drones to track properly if she’s strafing on the ground but in the air assuming you’re close enough it should be enough to stagger her. If Twin Palm Strike manages to hit her gamma finisher on you she is armored during it so you cannot stun her out of it with drones. This fight is determined by who can bait out the other person’s important cooldowns first.

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ibara does a lot of damage if you let her get close to you or if she lands a few good alphas but you have the mobility to easily bait and evade her. Just bait and dodge her alpha and beta with your own alphas and betas and this fight should be quick and easy.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Most of the things Mirio can do are things that you can roll since his charged alpha and beta have a lot of start up. His gamma and uncharged alpha come out quick and can definitely connect if you don’t expect them, but one missed attack from him means you automatically win the fight as one of your combos or even firing a few Flame Bullet Shots at him is enough for most Mirios to leave the fight right then and there. If you know a Mirio is around keep an eye on your surroundings and potential charged alpha jump scare spots and remember that whenever Mirio is using his beta he makes an audible noise giving away his location letting you know if you should be ready to dodge roll or not. This will limit the chances he has to get the jump on you which is what Mirio thrives on. Performing riskier combos on enemy Mirios isn't recommended since he can use Special Action to break out of combos very easily and the down time on most of the riskier combos is more than enough for him to use Special Action to escape it.

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
This character is way too much even for the versatile Armored All Might. Sheer Counter has more i-frames than Rapid Mirio does on all of his moves, he can attack WHILE those i-frames are active on ALL of his Quirk Skills whereas Rapid Mirio can only do that after a charged alpha, and has the titular counter he can use on REACTION to most moves in the game all of Armored All Might’s Quirk Skills included. You’ll be lucky to get a hit in if Sheer Counter is using alpha, and you can’t risk attacking him when he’s not in the middle of an attack because of counter, so the only choice you have in most situations is pray he uses beta and misses as the end of beta has consistently long end lag that you can use to punish. Sheer Counter also has some end lag at the end of their counter but Sheer Counter has a bug that makes the i-frames from the counter last longer than intended so the window is pretty tight to punish him if he doesn’t activate a counter. Overall, this fight is a mess and one that you should try to take with your team if possible so you can overwhelm him with numbers. Due to this character’s Special Action and counter doing riskier combos is ill advised as he can either break out of them with permeation or hit you with a counter since both of these moves come out very quick and the downtime between your attacks during the riskier combos is more than enough for him to perform either of these actions.

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tamaki’s main source of damage is from his combos that start with grabbing you with alpha which won’t be a problem as long as you use dodge rolls and tap Special Action efficiently. Tamaki does get a lot of chances to grab you however, and a good one will stop trying to go for grabs and start poking you with his unaimed alpha if he notices you’re dodging all his grabs, and when this happens you want to switch from dodging and weaving in alphas to getting out of his alpha range so you can try and start a combo. The reason you can’t try to get out of his alpha range when he’s going for grabs is because he’ll just grab you before you can escape. Drones do hard counter his combo attempts so having drones up against Tamaki is very important.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You have more movement, combo potential, and burst damage than Nejire. Since Nejire doesn’t have a way to go up besides using gamma you can attempt to perform an air bash combo on her by going directly above her and using beta, but you’d need to start the fight at a height advantage as if you try to do this mid-fight she’ll just dash away. Making her dash away does however make it easy for you to beam her or perform one of the combos you’d use for an aerial enemy caught in Blackphane. Generally though, just match her height and try to dodge her slow moving projectiles and this fight should be an easy win. 
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both Armored All Might and Shinso are great in a 1v1 so this fight is more so who can keep up the most pressure since a missed attack on Shinso’s end is a big punish for you while a mistimed roll on your end is also a big punish for him. Shinso’s alpha can grab you out of all of your options and once he does grab you your drones bug out and don’t track him properly so it’s harder to get out of his combos. Harder, not impossible because your drones will track properly after Shinso slams you so if you get hit by Shinso’s alpha wait until after you get slammed to stagger with drones. Unfortunately, if the Shinso goes for beta right after he alphas he’ll be able to hit the beta before your drones hit him and you lose the damage trade. Dodging while trying to stagger Shinso with drones will be key in winning this encounter.

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Everything All Might can do has a decent amount of start up/end lag so as long as you can dodge his laggy moves you should be all good. All Might’s gamma can block all the attacks you can do, but he does have a bit of lag after so just be patient and strike when he’s vulnerable. If he tries to Special Action away you can use beta to grab him out of it but if he does get it off you have more than enough mobility to chase if it’s appropriate to do so.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatling has really good movement with beta, burst damage with gamma, and a really nice armored move in alpha. Thankfully, his movement isn’t better than yours, his burst damage can be avoided by keeping your distance, and his alpha you can grab him out of with beta. Do keep in mind that since Gatling is armored during alpha he will take many more Alpha (Ice Bullet Shot)s to freeze and even 4 drones is not enough to stagger him so using beta to kick him out of alpha would be your best bet if you wish to fight him. If you have your drones out and Gatling hits you with gamma you can shoot two drones to stagger him out of it if you’re quick enough, but if you’re too late you’re eating the gamma damage as the drones cannot track him well and he gets armor after he leaps into the air.

## Armored All Might <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch200_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
A mirror match so the better player wins. To get an edge over your evil clone move unpredictably and if you know you’re about to get hit by two or more drones shoot two drones back and since you’ll be staggered first you’ll recover first meaning you can punish the other Armored All Might. If the other Armored All Might tries to get a height advantage either match his height, grapple from below and combo him from there, or stagger them with drones.  
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Aizawa, like Shinso, is incredibly good in a 1v1 and even more so if the Aizawa knows what he’s doing. It is imperative that you have drones up before an Aizawa starts his onslaught as if you have your drones out and Aizawa erases your Quirk you can still shoot drones. Aizawa’s gamma can block all of your Quirk Skills so don’t bother wasting time trying to hit him through it. The same drone bugginess with Shinso’s alpha also occurs with Aizawa’s alpha so make sure you wait until he pulls you in before you shoot your drones for a stagger. Your drones are actually a very nice tool against Aizawa since it can break his flow and miss up his combos enough for you to get an edge in. This fight will definitely take some focus to get through but it is entirely possible to win the 1v1.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Mic’s damage is simply too much to handle even with all of your tools. You can’t out beam him because his alpha and beta with boomboxes do way too much and you can’t get close to him because he’ll just tap beta into gamma for a free guard break. You do have drones, but that’s your only reliable way to get in unless you are really confident with trying to hit betas while constant 300 damage hit boxes are barreling towards your direction. Try to keep your distance and stagger Mic with drones before you go in for the kill to prevent taking massive amounts of burst damage.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Cementoss can create cover on demand which is really unfortunate for someone who’s biggest weakness is the enemy having cover. If you try to get close to Cementoss or he sees you he’s most likely going to put up some walls and make it very hard for you to keep being close to him. You do have the height advantage with your Special Action, but he can create cover from aerial foes so it’s hard to get in from the air as well. When Cementoss pillars up with his alpha, that's your chance to strike by matching his height and either shooting at him or comboing him. If possible try to stay in the air or at least have high ground on him to make it harder for him to attack you and if he covers his head with gamma and you need to continue fighting him get on the ground but do not get too close to him as every Quirk Skill he has can deal with close range enemies. 
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor has a slower flight than you, less air time than you, and he requires a lot more mechanical skill from the opponent to perform well. That being said it’s important to always stay on the move against an Endeavor as making him miss his alphas and betas is crucial to weakening Endeavor’s damage output. Do also keep in mind when chasing Endeavor that he can throw betas in a way to cover doorways and hallways so try not to fall for this when chasing him. If Endeavor tries to run away you have more than enough movement to catch up to him so the main thing to worry about with this fight is avoiding his attacks while trying to get in with your beta and drones.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Inferno Fist generally stays in the air while he uses his abilities which makes him a very easy target for you to latch onto with beta or stun with your drones. If you are hit by Inferno Fist’s beta you can fly up and away from it, and if you are hit by Inferno Fist’s gamma on GP you just have to take the damage as his gamma stuns you in place if hit on GP with your only option being to shoot out your drones to get some damage in and stagger. Remember to hold down gamma to shoot all your remaining drones since tapping gamma shoots the drones weirdly if caught in his gamma. If you are hit on HP by his gamma you can either use tap Special Action to get some distance from Inferno Fist before the gamma puts you into a hard knockdown or use your drones to stagger him to prevent any follow-ups from Inferno FIst. If you decide on the drone option then make sure you stagger him twice with 4 drones with two being shot as he shoots his gamma, and two being shot after the first stagger ends. This will prevent him from following up with alpha or beta so less pressure is on you. If you can then you should obviously stagger him before the gamma is shot out so you don’t have to worry about it in the first place but if you are hit by it you aren’t out of options (if you have drones up that is). Getting a height advantage on Inferno Fist will also put him at a disadvantage so aim for that if possible.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Hawks can be tricky to land hits on if manages to land a beta on you, but otherwise he’s not a huge threat. While he has wings he cannot use them to get a height advantage over you without wasting beta or gamma charges so getting a height advantage puts more pressure on him to waste those Quirk Skills for movement. As long as you’re making good use of tap Special Action Hawks’s alpha will have a hard time hitting you as well. Other than that it’s the same as usual which means using alpha and looking for an opening to combo off of or making your own with gamma.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Slicing Wind has more movement, damage and combos compared to Rapid Hawks making him a much bigger threat. When Slicing Wind has a level 7 or higher his hold beta has armor during the start of it meaning you cannot use drones to stagger him out of the start of his beta, but you can stagger him after the dash of his beta preventing him from comboing off of beta. Using your drones to break out of Slicing Wind’s gamma is also a key part in winning against him. Keeping a height advantage will force Slicing Wind to use their Quirk Skills to match your height, but do take care to not go too high as Slicing Wind’s tap alpha stagger loops can be devastating for your health. Make sure you take advantage of the long end lag Slicing Wind has after using hold alpha and beta by using your own betas to combo off his end lag. Having good aim against Slicing Wind is very important as this character is very quick and can be hard to hit.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Another case of getting a height advantage over her makes her unable to do anything to you. Her alpha has short range, her beta can’t hit aerial targets, and her gamma doesn’t have that much travel distance. If she is using her Special Action it is advised to not use beta against her as you will either be pulled towards a kick/stomp or do minimal damage as you cannot stun her in place or stagger with drones when she is in her Special Action. 

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
None of his Quirk Skills can hit aerial enemies so a height advantage just wins you the fight. Shigaraki can use his Special Action upwards to get some height so as long as you avoid that range you should be fine. If you must fight this character inside of a building try to stay in the air and use alphas to freeze to prevent him from using Special Action to hit you.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
While Catastrophe has a way to move up it’s not a reliable way to hit you. Same things said about Strike Shigaraki apply here as well but just be careful about getting too close to the ground as the punishment for doing so is much worse than with Strike Shigaraki due to the insane damage combos Catastrophe has access to.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Thousand-Hand Break) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var2_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Thousand-Hand Break’s moves all have a decent amount of start up and end lag so catching his openings shouldn’t be hard, just beta him once you dodge his alpha or beta if you have line of sight on him. If you’re above him he has a much harder time aiming his alpha and beta to hit you so make sure to get a height advantage over him if possible. His gamma combined with certain T.U.N.I.N.G. builds makes him nigh immortal which makes him much harder to kill but still has the same drawbacks mentioned already. Thousand-Hand Break doesn’t have armor on any of his Quirk Skills as well so using drones to kick him out of his Quirk Skills can be really nice especially gamma as preventing him from activating it makes him much easier to kill. As a side note make sure you pay attention to the green indicator on your screen as that means a Thousand-Hand Break is currently using Search and sees you though this also applies to when Aizawa uses Erasure on you.

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢/🟣Unknown🟣<br>
Depending on the Quirks All For One has plundered from someone this match-up could swing in multiple different ways. If All For One is using his base Quirks then there isn’t too much to worry about as if you’re in the air when he decides to use gamma you can fly up faster than it takes his gamma to pull you in, his alpha isn’t too threatening and you win the beamer 1v1, and his beta can’t hit you in the air easily. If you do happen to be grabbed by him, get ready to shoot drones at him to prevent any follow-ups. Just pay attention during this fight as without knowing what his second set of Quirks are it’s hard to have a proper gameplan. 
<br>

## All For One -Youth age- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch201_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Young All For One doesn’t have anything crazy threatening he can use against you. His alpha is good but without the extra damage he gets from the explosion it’s nothing crazy, his beta can knock you and let him get an alpha or Special Action off which can be scary especially if he seals your Special Action, and gamma if not avoided properly can let him loop you with it until the big explosion at the end. If you are in the air his alpha does less damage so being in the air is preferable, and you can use tap Special Action to avoid his beta as the further away you are from the start of his beta the more time it’ll take to reach you, and to avoid the gamma loop if you get hit wait a bit to make use of i-frames, fly up quickly, and then grab him with beta since your beta can kick him out of his gamma. Do not attempt to use drones when he is in his gamma as he has armor during it and 4 drones won’t be enough to stagger him. At all costs try to avoid getting hit by his Special Action because once your Special Action is sealed you lose a lot of pressure you would've otherwise had against Young All For One.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Dabi’s alpha is too slow to hit you reliably and his beta and gamma do nothing to you in the air. Trying to combo a Dabi near his mines is ill-advised as you’ll either hit a mine and waste beta charges or latch onto Dabi but get hit by his mines. Fighting this character inside a building is also ill-advised as his gamma can make it hard to get in since it blocks all of your options and a good Dabi will have trapped the inside of his gamma to prevent people from rolling inside of it.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Crazy Torch cannot do much of anything to you while you’re in the air as long as you are outside of his beta’s range. Make sure when you dodge his beta to punish him with your own beta.  

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Toga’s mobility is really good for how much damage she can do with her alpha and beta. Toga’s beta isn’t too much of a problem if you’re in the air, but that leaves you open into getting beamed by her alpha where she can do similar amounts of damage to you if you try to out beam her. If you’re close to her it would instead be better to try and freeze her instead of trying to out damage her with alpha as a freeze will let you perform a combo that can do a lot of damage to her. If you are farther away it would be better to move unpredictably and hit her with your Flame Bullet Shots to knock her down so you can reposition into a better spot for a beta. If Toga hits you with her beta you can use your drones to stagger her out of the dash hit which will prevent you from taking a lot of damage. Toga also has a lot of end lag after she uses gamma which lets you either freeze her or beta her for a combo depending on how far away you are from Toga. 
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Watch out for her betas whenever you’re below Sting Dance as she can combo that into beta for more damage or gamma to take your blood easily. Her alpha can also pile on some damage if you’re not moving around a lot so trying to stay in the air and use Flame Bullet Shots isn’t advised. Playing grounded will most likely end with you getting beta’d, but staying in the air will most likely get you hit by either alpha or gamma, so your best option would be to fly up into the air, make her waste alphas and gammas trying to chase you, and while she’s chasing you beta her to start a combo. Alternatively, if you manage to catch Sting Dance's gamma end lag that is a very free combo for you since her gamma has very long end lag for a movement tool. You can also use drones to stop her from performing a combo off of beta if she does end up getting the jump on you.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Twice’s alpha has good range and can hit you even when you’re high up but that’s kinda all he has. His gamma is not very good mobility at all and while his beta does create an extra enemy to shoot at, its aim isn’t the best. Getting a height advantage over Twice basically confines him to using alpha which you do better than him so he just dies.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress can do good damage to you if he manages to catch you out while having very good mobility at gamma level 9. His beta also either reflects or blocks all of your options meaning you HAVE to fight him up close which can be uncomfortable in tight corridors or small buildings where his trucks have a hard time missing you. Thankfully, your melee is very good and can very easily hit him quickly if meleeing after Special Action, and if he’s throwing trucks at you he can’t pull up beta to block your drones, but without drones this fight becomes a bit tricky. Your drones and beta can also force Compress out of his marble when he uses gamma meaning if you’re in the air when Compress decides to gamma you can chase him and use drones to stagger him out of his marble for a free punish.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Overhaul cannot do much of anything to you while you’re in the air so flying above him is preferred. If you have to fight him on the ground make sure to roll his gamma and counter with drones so you can use a beta afterwards for big damage.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri will have a hard time landing hits on you, but you’ll also have a hard time hitting Kurogiri if he uses his portals effectively. Being in the air makes Kurogiri have a harder time hitting you with alpha and beta but take care not to hover in place as that gives Kurogiri a free quadruple beta combo for massive damage on you. Hitting Kurogiri with drones to keep him in place will make it much easier to do damage to him as otherwise you’ll have to keep chasing him through portals to do damage to him which is incredibly annoying and separates you from your team.
