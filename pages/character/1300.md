Aizawa is an agile character that excels in one-on-one combat, dealing huge amounts of damage, but also struggles when there's a group of opponents. He can support his allies defensively and offensively through locking the enemy's skills to escape or get the upper hand in a fight, and as a grab character, he can shut down most escape attempts with enough aim.<br>

This ability has two variations: Ground Version and Air Version.

**Ground Version**</br>
This ability allows you to shoot a binding cloth which can bind the enemy, making them stun locked. This move can be used with and without an input, if you press again you will pull your enemy faster. Most people don't use it, but it saves time, unless you wish to bind them for a longer period, in which case don't press any buttons after the move lands. Each has its own uses, for example, the fast pull is a good way to quickly act against the enemy without remaining vulnerable for too long, while the delayed pull makes it easier for your team to combo the enemy, however, a teammate can also break your own combos for less value if they use a skill with lower damage and high downpower. This ability's grab works on superarmor targets too, allowing you to get the upper hand or prevent escape.

</p>

**Air Version**</br>
Triggered by hitting an opponent or a solid surface while mid-air. Another version of the move used for both mobility and offense. This variation allows Aizawa to propel himself towards the target with a kick while stun-locking them, dealing damage. If there's a non-ceiling surface close enough, or if the binding cloth hits a solid surface, then the kick will impact the surface and he will bounce off, creating a shockwave that does additional damage.<br>

</p>
<br>
Hitting a slope in the right angle, an enemy, or a ceiling will cause Aizawa to be pulled in that direction without bouncing off, useful for escaping, however he will not deal shockwave damage, this is why this move deals the most damage on ground opponents. After bouncing, you can follow up with a gamma, though not really recommended. Instead, you can follow up with another alpha, as bouncing around can make you more agile and harder to hit by the opponent's teammates or any third parties. Additionally, you choose the direction you will bounce off to by simply pressing a direction input. Against wall, inputting forward will make you bounce closer to the wall, while inputting backwards will make you bounce farther from the wall.

## Beta Skill - Powerhouse Barrage Kick
<p align="center">

</p>
A simple rapid kick dash. This ability is slow and deals low damage that often struggles to connect all hits with, for this reason, it's the lowest priority when it comes to leveling your skills. This ability's strongest offensive value is against corners, especially if you catch them mid-air, since the skill's low downpower allows you to go for two betas in a row, but outside of this, you don't really want to use beta offensively.

</p>

Beta's main use is as a mobility tool, because even though it's slow and does not take you as far as alpha, it requires no solid surfaces and helps with getting on top of buildings, since alpha alone can't take you on top of a building most of the time, due to the fact it pulls you towards the location you hit rather than above it, but with the help of beta, this isn't an issue.

## Gamma Skill - Binding Cloth: Serpent
<p align="center">

</p>
Gamma is Aizawa's most damaging move. This ability is often used as a follow-up to ground alpha, and it has the upside of blocking projectiles it comes in contact with, meaning you can damage an opponent and block projectiles coming at you, as well as skills such as Strike Shigaraki's alpha and beta. This ability however keeps him locked in place, and the projectile blocking property only applies to those that come from the front, he's vulnerable from behind.<br>
Using this ability mid-air will expand the projectile-blocking area below you and allow you to float while casting it. Gamma can also be used against an opponent who is very close but not close enough for melee, and it traps opponents very decently if used well in tight spaces, buildings, corners and such, it's especially useful if they don't use their invincibility frames after getting up. Careful not to land the move prematurely or they will escape.  This move has strange hitboxes at the back and sides of at the moment of initiation,  as it hits the opponent before the full execution of the move. This hit pulls the opponent forward into the move. Additionally, since htis move keeps enemies stunned in place, it's useful for quick team combos.

## Special Action - Erasure
<p align="center">

</p>
Aizawa's Special Action allows him to lock the skills of enemies he's looking at, making them unable to use them. This can be used to give yourself of your team a window to stop their offense and initiate yours, as they will be vulnerable, especially to ground attacks like Strike Shigaraki's alpha and Strike Shoto's gamma. This ability does not "erase" special actions or basic attacks, only quirk skills alpha, beta and gamma, meaning that some characters can still be dangerous even under the influence of this ability, such as Shinso and Iida. Furthermore, this ability only works on enemies in your field of view, so enemies behind you won't get affected by it, this also means that the effect can be temporarily broken by hiding behind an obstacle. Additionally, even though you can use this move to cut off enemy attacks, the effect does not trigger immediately, so it might not protect you from an attack if you use it too late.
<p align="center">

</p><br>

It's recommended to not waste this ability's duration and just use it as a quick confusion tool to get the upper hand with an alpha or other ally attacks, this way you will be able to use it again soon. If the enemy starts rolling, do not waste alphas, just wait for the right moment.<br>
<br>
This ability can also be used to shut down shields, making it useful to deal with characters such as Assault Kendo and Strike Kirishima, or stall the duration of powerful stances such as a Giant Mt Lady. It can also interrupt a character using their skills to run away, however keep in mind that some mobility options carry a lot of momentum, so your erasure might instead yeet them away at high speeds, which can be annoying when the zone is big, but can be useful if it's small, as they could end up inside the Poison Mist.<br>
<br>
You can use this move up close, in which case you should be ready to use basic melee attacks, as that's what the opponent will try to do.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
**Ground Melee**<br>
A 3-string combo chain. You can use this to stagger the opponent by repeating the first melee hit until they're knocked down to give yourself more time, though its most common usage is as a tool to activate special tunings that require basic attacks, as his alpha makes it easier for him to trigger these effects.

</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Aizawa’s air melee is a useful mobility tool that can be used in combos with an air alpha into kick, and as Aizawa bounces off the surface he makes contact with, you can use your melee to change your direction for more unpredictable movements to gain an advantage against your opponent.

### Hybrid Serpent Path
A path to strengthen your gamma to get the most of it's damage while avoiding alpha neglecting.

### Why is Beta always last?
Beta is a slow skill with unremarkable damage for the most part, it's main function is to serve as mobility, since alpha and gamma both are his main sources of damage. No great benefit comes from a level 9 Beta over leveling anything else in his kit.

### Why not Alpha Level 9 from the get go?

### Why not Gamma Level 4-9 first?
