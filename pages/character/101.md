Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) is an all-rounder character that excels at catching wake-ups. He differs from the average all-rounder by providing different utility in the form of inturuption with his alpha knockdown and beta grab. His burst damage is notably high at all ranges but he lacks armor and often struggles with mobility and survivability.<br>

## Alpha Skill - Delaware Smash Full Bullet 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101a.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

This is the simplest part of the kit, a projectile skill that works like a shotgun, splitting the damage across 5 pellets. Taking 10 pellets will cause the player to be knocked down, which can be really useful to interrupt both escape and attack attempts.
This skill has two variations: The Aimed and Unaimed versions.

**Unaimed Version**</br>
This variation is niche and overall limited, having a short reach for a ranged skill in exchange for a wider spread, making it easier to land at the cost of landing less pellets, resulting in lower damage. The best use cases for it are finishing a downed person from close range or when kitting the opponent and you'd rather guarantee 3 pellets connecting rather than risking a miss entirely. If your aim is solid you will never need this version at all.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101a-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

**Aimed Version**</br>
This is what you should do basically every time you use alpha, as this increases its range significantly, allowing it to reach twice as far as the unaimed version. Furthermore, the pellets don't get spread, which makes it easier to connect all 5 pellets for full damage. This variation has no downsides, so it's recommended to abuse it as much as possible.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101a2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
It's recommended to increase your aimed-in sensitivity because of how often this skill is aimed in, since you'll need the ability to make larger adjustments to your aim faster than other characters that don't rely in aimed shots, due to how aiming in reduces the camera's speed.

A common technique you can use in extremely close range or against rapid character is to get around the slow camera speed is to switch off the aiming mode for camera control, and then switch on to shoot. If you're not comfortable with super high sensitivity, this technique might be helpful.
 
This skill is also very sensitive to damage modifiers due to how the game handles rounding damage, this means that even small buffs can lead to a substantial increase in damage compared to most other skills. However, this in turn means that enemies with defense buffs take noticeably less damage.

## Beta Skill - Manchester Smash 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101b.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

An AoE attack that gets stronger and larger when used from high heights. Hitting the enemy directly with the heel will make them take additional damage in the form of True Damage. The reload time of each charge is quite long, however the penalty reload time is pretty forgiving in comparison, so one shouldn't worry too much about conserving beta ammo. 

Full Bullet beta at all sizes and levels now has the ability to destroy all player built structures that are made by your team in one hit including your own gamma.

**Grounded Beta**</br>
When used while touching the ground, this skill will be preceeded by a forward leap that helps you close distances. This ability has strong tracking when an enemy is close enough, which makes it great to catch wake-ups. One of the best setups for it is to use alpha twice to knock the enemy to the ground, and as the enemy gets up use beta to catch their wake. Regardless of what direction they get up, this skill will track onto them. It's a very good ability against mashers, and even has a tech known as Beta Canceling against people who use their i-frames more wisely.

</p>

**Jump Beta**</br>
Used by using beta after jumping. This version of the skill is primarily used defensively as it's basically the grounded beta without tracking. This ability can be used to catch people that are approaching you too recklessly without armor, however it's advised to stick to grounded beta for the tracking. You can use it to catch mashers who wake early by grabbing with the heel but this is niche at higher levels of Full Bullet play due to Beta Canceling.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101b2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

**Height-Boosted Beta**</br>
This beta version is primarily used to get large amounts of spread damage in a fight when people don't know where you are. This is highly likely to go poorly if you don't sneak-attack the enemy group. Attempting this in a 1v1 situation without breaking line of sight first is a bad idea and will often result in you getting punished. It's recommended to save this for catching entire teams or group fights off-guard with massive AoE damage and poke with alphas whoever is still alive. This version of the beta is achieved by using the skill from a high position, setup by the stage or by his gamma skill. Due to a issue currently you will find landing this to be much more difficult. Your momentum is forced forwards which means that you need to hold back before using the beta with the amount you hold back depending on your hight and amount of momentum you have.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Ground Impact 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101y.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This skill is a valuable and versatile combo-enabling tool with mobility, defensive and offensive applications. You can have a max of 3 rock pieces at once, with levels 4 and 9 adding more rock pieces to gamma but not increasing the maximum amount of rocks that can remain on the field. Going above this limit will destroy the oldest.</br>

<br>**Gamma as Mobility Tool**</br>
When holding gamma, you will create a stone ramp followed by a huge jump. The jump's strength is influenced by your camera's angle at the moment of jumping, for example, looking up will allow you to jump really high, while as if you look down instead, the jump will barely lift you off the ground. It's a very strong skill when it comes to vertical mobility, but it isn't great as horizontal mobility, which is why you shouldn't ever use gamma for horizontal movement. It's preferable to not use both charges to avoid the 10 seconds of penalty reload time and instead only use one and wait for it to come back, as the base reload time is 6 seconds long. If you must use 2 charges however, it's recommended that you use them in a short time span, such as using the first charge to jump on top of a building, and the second one to jump on top of an even higher building. This is so that you don't waste reload time, since if you use gamma followed by alpha spam/beta, and then you use gamma again, the time you spent reloading the charge you just used will be wasted, essentially turning an overall reload time of 11-12 seconds into 14-16 seconds.

    <small><em>High jump by looking up.</em></small>
</p>

**Gamma as Offensive Tool**</br>
This effectively acts as a faster version of beta that does less damage, has no linger, and costs a more valuable resource since gamma is also your mobility. This skill can be tough to land against rush down characters. Using this skill for combat is fairly viable due to the large amount of combos you can get after a gamma.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101y3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>
This ability can also damage the enemy through thinner walls, making it an option when you hear an enemy drinking or resurrecting a teammate near a wall. While this skill can also be used to trap characters in buildings and force them to take another exit and potentially lead them to Poison Mist DMG, most of the time it's better to save that gamma charge for either mobility or combos.

<br>**Gamma as Defensive Tool**</br>
This skill is very poor defensively as of the current update, since it only blocks ground based attacks like Shigaraki's alpha, Overhaul's gamma, and Strike Kirishima's beta and its durability is quite lackluster. This skills defensive applications should be exclusively used as a way to block doorways, which can also be used aggressively to trap opponents indoors with you. Overall, you shouldn't expect this skill to protect you from anything.

    <small><em>Using gamma as a defensive wall.</em></small>
</p>
It is strongly advised to never use gamma from very high in the air. If your goal is to catch a wake-up, beta is a better option, and if one's out of betas, then alpha or air melee are better options, depending on your distance from the enemy. This ability's reload time isn't bad, but also not forgiving enough to spam it, and because it acts as your combo extender and mobility, you shouldn't waste it when something else does a better job.<br>

## Special Action - Carry to Safety
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/100s.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
An ability that allows you to save your downed teammates by carrying them and help them get up. It's a limited ability that can come handy from time to time.
After picking up a teammate, this skill has two parts: Carrying and Dropping.

<br>**Carrying**</br>
While carrying, you will be able to reposition your downed teammate. It's strongly recommended to never carry your ally elsewhere, as you're left without any means of defending yourself, becoming a damage sponge, which on top of that can knock your ally out of your back, preventing your teammate from getting-up and wasting health and potentially leading to both your death and your teammate's death. The only scenario where you could carry your ally is if they died in the Poison Mist and there are no enemies around to attack you.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

<br>**Dropping**</br>
Immediately after picking up your downed teammate, you want to drop them as soon as possible. This allows you to get your teammate back up instantly and allow you to keep fighting right away, however it's still really risky, as the time it takes you to pick up and ally and drop them is enough for any good player to take away half your health. The only context where you should use it in a fight is when you or your other teammate manage to create a window in which you can safely pick and drop your downed teammate, such as when you knock down the enemy with 2 alphas or, in open fights, after knocking everyone away with beta. The Special Action's whole gauge has a 1 second reload time, so in practice it has no cooldown.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 4-string combo chain with low range and somewhat slow endlag. This should be a last resort option, since Full Bullet excels at short range but not quite point blank, so if an enemy gets close enough to get hit by melee then it's likely you or/and your enemy made a mistake, since at peak levels of Full Bullet this will rarely come into play.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/100m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This move is usually fairly bad on Full Bullet but it has a few key advantages. Firstly, it's fast, very fast, and because of this, you can often use it to commbo-break against grapple characters like Aizawa and Tamaki that can get a bit greedy with their combos. Secondly, it has very little endlag. Unlike its ground counterpart where no matter when you stop you will be left vulnerable to punishing, his air melee doesn't have this issue, and instantly cancels all endlag upon touching the ground, so it ends up being better than the ground variation. You can also destroy your own gamma with one air melee. This skill can also be used to destroy teamate built structures in a single hit.

</p>

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
Ideal for individuals with good aim, a path that makes the best use out of your alpha from the very beginning, recommended path for anyone not interested in beta-cancelling. Just stay in the backline and shoot alphas.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/a9b4y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### All-Rounder Path
This path gives access to beta cancels immediately, which opens up the combo game almost entirely and gives significantly increased survivability in the melee game due to beta cancels massively reducing beta endlag.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4a9y4b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Melee Path
An alternative for those uninterested in aiming. However, this path is the worst of the three, as alpha levels contribute significantly to Full Bullet's raw damage, so it's hard to ignore them for so long.
<p align="left">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/b4y4a9b9.png"  width="800"/></br>
</p>

### Why is Gamma Lvl.4 recommended before Beta Lvl.9?
A third beta is nice, but often redundant as 2 allow you to do most things well, meanwhile, the size increase at Gamma Lvl.4 is very good at blocking doorways and making raw gamma more viable.

### What about Gamma Lvl.9?
At Lvl.9, Gamma doesn't change most interactions even though it gets bigger, that's why it's recommended to instead lend the level cards to trusted teammates instead if you're at Alpha Lvl.9, Beta Lvl.4-9 and Gamma Lvl.4, especially if they're falling behind level-wise.

## Techs
### Hop Gamma
An optimization you can do is to perform a short hop + Gamma, as the grouned Gamma animation is actually slower than the jump startup animation and air Gamma animation combined. It's a minor optimization, but it has more uses in combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta Canceling
This way of using beta and gamma is extremely potent. This tech is performed by using beta right after having used another beta. By default, this skill has noticeable endlag, however beta can be used again before the
endlag is over. While starting the leap animation for the second beta, you can immediately cancel the whole animation for the second beta and perform a gamma instead. This is much faster than waiting for the endlag and perform a gamma after. The primary use of this tech is for combos, as many rely on Beta Canceling to work, however, it's also incredibly useful for Full Bullet's survival, as it reduces the punishing window for his beta, which usually leaves you defenseless for a second. With this not only you make yourself less vulnerable, but also allows you to position yourself better and follow up with alphas or another beta if the later is level 9.
This tech can only be used at Beta level 4 or above, as the canceling requires a second beta.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Full Bullet's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 50 DP (Pellet), 250 DP (All Pellets)<br>
Beta Skill: 100 DP (Shockwave), 100 DP (Grab)<br>
Gamma Skill: 100 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3-4: 100 DP (Individually), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 100 DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is displayed from all skills at lowest level to all level 9.

The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

### Beta -> Alpha
Beta into alpha is only possible when you hit the shockwave either by knocking the opponent off a building/ledge or by catching the end of their roll.

</p>

<!-- ### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Beta (Heel)
A basic yet strong combo that's only really viable near a wall or low ceiling, as otherwise people can easily avoid the second beta by waking early. The combo only works on HP.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/101c0-gif.gif" width="400" />

</p> -->

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
A simple combo consisting of the first two melees, followed by a gamma that will push the enemy forward, and that you will be able to catch with a beta after jumping. The 1-2 melee into gamma can miss on GP, but even though it's really hard to, the beta can technically land. However, this combo is outclassed by other combos.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c1.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma -> Alpha 
A fairly easy combo that works on both GP and HP and takes advantage of the Hop Gamma tech, but that has the downsides of expending both of your gamma charges, leaving you grounded. The combo leaves room for a second alpha, but due to the high downpower buildup, the damage will be lower, so only use the second alpha if your team isn't around to follow up with their own attacks or if gamma knocks them out of the Poison Mist. You can choose to hold the gamma, which leads to a 50/50 where, if the opponent doesn't wake early you can land a free alpha, and if they do, you can come down with beta and catch the wake-up. Depending on the ammo you have leftover, full follow ups are possible here, as the wake resets downpower.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/101c2.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
This combo is super consistent and powerful. This combo requires at least beta 4. Aim the gamma nearly straight forward and it should hit nearly every time with little issues. This is a primary bread and butter combo to be used nearly every time you land beta heel.

</p>

### Beta (No Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma
A variation of the Beta into Beta Cancel into Gamma combo with lower damage that requires very specific positioning and doesn't work well up slopes, but follow ups are possible, especially with a wall. It can be used to catch people with i-frames, as they will often burn their i-frames to punish beta's endlag, letting the gamma connect. The 50/50 applies here too.

</p>

### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma -> Gamma -> Alpha
This combo is fairly consistent from a beta dragdown however its not always worth using due to its large ammo costs. Its still super strong when you just need to delete one target from the match. There are still some consistency issues so sometimes this will fail due to no fault of your own
<p align="center">

</p>

### Gamma -> Dash Jump -> Gamma Hold -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Beta**</a>
Another really strong combo that has the possibility of a follow up with alpha for an extra 24-40 DMG, but this follow up can be avoided by the enemy. For it to work, GP has to be broken with the second gamma or earlier. This combo can be made more consistent if the enemy is to your left or your right and by slightly angling the second gamma away from them. The gamma hold can be replaced by base gamma indoors for more reliability. Grounded beta works as a finisher with a low ceiling.

</p>

<!-- ### Beta (Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma Hold -> Beta
An extremely powerful combo that makes use of all 3 beta charges, for this reason, beta level 9 is mandatory to execute this combo. It can be made easier if you angle gamma to the sides. This combo has no follow up. In an open area, this combo is really inconsistent and rarely worth consider.

</p> -->

### Beta (No Heel) -> Beta Cancel -> Gamma -> Gamma -> Alpha
This combo is extremely difficult to do in open areas, requiring you to aim the gamma in a way that changes the direction the opponent is flying towards in order to get the second gamma to hit. You also need gamma 9 to hit without a wall. Not recommended to perform in an open area. This combo is extremely easy to do next to a wall or indoors, and is the only situation where you'd really go for this. Further follow-ups such as a beta (if you're indoors) or alpha are possible.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>The best individual tuning, allowing you to at the very least pop up a Small GP Drink while invincible. If the Guardbreaking hit did not knock you down, you can even pop a Large GP Drink instead if you're quick enough. If you're also running Wall Runner or Space Hop, you will be able to make use of their effects to escape or reposition without dispelling the invincibility. It also serves as a combo breaker, as upon breaking your guard, the combo will no longer be able to continue due to the invincibility.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>This one is simple. Full Bullet is a character that isn't bad early on but definitely reaches his maximum potential in the mid to endgame with some levels. This skill simply makes that faster and lets you give teammates levels or level speed/support cards depending on the situation.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br> This tune used to be a must have, but they made a shadow change that greatly nerfed the capability behind this tune, but if that ever gets reverted this part will he updated. For now, this skill is just a strong movement increase that allows for gamma conservation and lets you get out of fights more easily. This tune is quite high tech to master so perhaps starting with a simpler option like Card Duplication or GP Sucker until you get the rest down is better.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>This tune is just good on everyone. In a stack, the ability to not die one time every 60/90 seconds is quite big and allows for many clutch teamheals and general survival.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Fixer is only held back by its lack of good fit options. If there was a fit that could take better advantage of this skill without sacrificing soo much in either the other special tune or the regular tunes then this tune would likely be his second best. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch018_00.png" width="125"> | **HP Sucker** <br>A tune that increases frontline survivability, which is always nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch018_01.png" width="125"> | **GP Sucker** <br>Just like HP Sucker, it increases your frontline survivability, which is nice.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>20% PU per kill is really nice for snowballing late, but the main issue with this skill is that it competes with Willpower and you lose an alpha DMG tune to run it.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_00.png" width="125"> | **Symbol of Peace** <br>60% PU at the start of the game can be the make or break, and since Full Bullet's weakest point in the match is the early game, an early game PU could be massive.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Strike** <br>This tune is a simple damage increase that ends up buffing the alpha damage even more, so it's a solid option for increasing general damage.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support** <br>Another tune that simply increases Full Bullet's survivability, it's nice.|
<img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>This tune is best used in combination with PU gain tunes like Crushing PU Charge and I would recommend stacking this with large beta damage stacking builds to best abuse the armor gained.|
<img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Ability Manifest is a strong but hard tune to use properly. Stacking Assault and Support cards for use in combat when needed massively increases survability and makes this a very strong option if you can properly use it.|

            <p>The build with the highest survivability, trading some alpha DMG for the possibility to combine Revenge
                Support and Critical Permeation to replenish both HP and GP mid-battle. This build might not be very
                future-proof however, as any significant nerfs to Critical Permeation will greatly affect its viability.

                tunes and all 3 alpha DMG tunes while also having good defense slots for HP and alpha defense. It also
                has good special tunes supporting Willpower/Revenge Strike and Card Duplication/GP Sucker, of which
                Willpower and Card Duplication are recommended.

            <p>Similar fit to the previous one, but exchanges some defense for an extra strike slot which is best used
                for beta damage. The best use case for this fit is to act like the previous fit in many ways but it's
                recommended to only run it with Wall Runner and Revenge Strike, unless you don't have the previous skin,
                then you can use this fit with Card Duplication or GP Sucker and it will be almost as good.

            <p>This is the best build that makes use of a tech slot. Using this for tunes like High-Speed Replishment
                and Electrification. However for more specialized tunes like Critical Permeation I would suggest other
                options listed here.

                Additionally. this costume ends up being very good, as all the damage tunes combined with the excellent

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
There will rarely be a situation where you can't shoot the Deku but he can, so even though Assault Deku has more range, your superior damage and melee game should let you win. Watch out for blackwhip combos if you go into the air with gamma or decide not to beta cancel the endlag on beta, as these are very open windows for Deku to shoot you.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Your choice of level path dramatically changes this match-up depending on their level path. A Full Bullet with alpha level.4 will usually beat a full bullet with beta level.4 unless you're fighting near very tight buildings. Aside from that, it's a mirror match, so whoever plays best will win.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Strike Bakugo is very simular to Assault Deku, except he trades the range for high burst from beta-alpha and beta-gamma combos. Keep in mind that due to Strike Bakugo's startup-laggy wake-up options, he's much more prone to being catched with beta on his wake-up than almost any other member in the cast. You should win in a ranged fight or close ranged fight, but if bakugo gets the jump with a beta-alpha combo you can find yourself struggling.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Bakugo's alpha damage is high enough to challenge you quite well, but like regular Bakugo, he doesn't have good wake-up options. If you're feeling spicy you can catch his gamma before the explosion comes out with your beta heel, but this is risky and hard to do. If you can hit him out of the air then you'll do fine.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Ochaco is able to stack on large damage against you very easily if you use beta or gamma by catching your landing with her gamma. If you get hit by Ochaco's gamma you will lose the fight so be careful and keep yourself grounded and out of endlag so you can always roll it. If the Ochaco tries to spam cars at you in GP you can break the combo even in the air with alpha since she leaves small windows in between betas where you can land alphas, which will knock her down afterl anding the second.
<br>


## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Assault Ochaco is full of endlag-heavy options with her alpha and beta. If you can get good at catching her beta while she's running with alphas you should win almost every time. Just be weary of gamma and try to stick to alphas against her, since her beta will interrupt your melee options very easily and effectively.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Iida outputs more damage from close distance and has armored options, so getting close is very risky. He's also able to break the wake-up catches with alpha or beta if he's smart. If your aim is unreasonably good then alphas is your best answer to Iida, but he's the hardest character to hit in the game with projectiles so good luck. Your best option is to try and catch him while he's burned out with alphas or by punishing the endlag of beta by rolling it and shooting an alpha. Trying melee options is often quite risky. Jump beta can beat out a reckless iida but be weary that if you dont hit him away with the beta then you'll lose half or more of your total HP/GP from an Iida combo.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Strike Shoto's range isn't the issue here, the issue is his gamma being able to greatly punish your beta, causing you to lose most of your health, and beta cancels dont help here since gamma doesn't block shotos gamma. Getting close is also a risky option since Strike Shoto's beta beats you out quite easily. To win use your vertical mobility to get high out of his beta and gammas range and shoot him with alphas. It will be tough but you can win this match-up with some strong aim and positioning.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Going in the air can midagate everything Tech Shoto does, but if he's indoors it's better to not even try to fight him unless you already know he's super weak. When indoors against him simply keep yourself grounded and prepared to roll his beta's explosion. Combos won't often work against him since his alpha's ice will interrupt them most of the time.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Froppy has no way to beat you when you simply use alpha to catch her mobility or when you're too far away, and beta to punish her own betas. However, Froppy won't often face you in an even fight so be prepared to fight one off whenever you see one by keeping yourself as high health as the team fight allows to avoid a sneaky Froppy striking the moment you find yourself vulnerable.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
When kirishima gets close it can be quite hard to escape him without taking large amounts of damage, since your own wake-up options are quite bad. However, his alpha, beta and gamma all have openings to punish with alpha, so if he somehow gets close to you then knocking him down with 2 alphas is the best and only way to escape reliably.  Simply beat him by spamming alpha to make sure he never gets close and you'll win every time.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Strike Kirishima is able to punish every option you have very heavily, with either his rock to punish being in the air from your gamma or using beta -> alpha -> gamma to punish your beta. That said his gamma does have a window to shoot him with alphas, but if the Kirishima has Hardening up he's usually trading 100 DMG taken for 250 dealt, so even this is bad to do consistently. If you're close enough your gamma goes through his beta shield, but if he's smart he will let go of beta when you get that close and punish you for trying. You can contribute in the fight against one by punishing his gamma and beta with your alpha, but if these are aimed at you then you're probably screwed.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Strike Denki is another beamer that you win against in the alpha trade department. Your beta is also fantastic at catching his wakeup since his mobility tool has a bad startup. Just be cautious that he doesn't punish you with a gamma, since if he does you will die, so if he doesn't burn his i-frames and get caught by the beta, then you can beta cancel in the direction of the Denki and gamma to avoid a free stun on his part by either using gamma as a wall or by damaging him with it.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
This match-up is largely dependent on the situation. Your alpha is great at catching his slow gamma start-up and beta, but he's also great at punishing you with his own beta into alpha spam. You can catch his wake-up rather easily with your beta however. If he's super far away just try to stay near cover to break his line of sight.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
If momo gets close, it can be hard to escape her, but if you simply treat her like Assault Kirishima and never let her get close, you will win. That said her beta dash makes for a much better way to close the gap than Assault Kirishima does, and if she gets close she will be able to keep you still and prevent your escape with her alpha or gamma. Never fight one in doors and play cautiously against one.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
You lose if the Monoma has good abilities but it's so hard to know what abilities he will have, hence, the match-up doesn't have a fixed difficulty. That said, just hit your alphas. Anything else is too risky to go for, given his kit and especially his gamma.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Just play and keep yourself away with gamma and alpha, she won't be able to touch you. She can catch you off guard and do large amounts of damage with her alpha and gamma though. If she's holding her beta out then just spam it with some high level alphas or get closer and use gamma to hit underneath the shield depending on range. Overall just stay far away and use height to your advantage.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
She doesn't really have many windows outside of alpha to hit her, and if you do hit her she just charges her beta and erases you. If the player knows what they're doing, you will lose this match-up almost every time.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ibara is one of the few characters that will out-stat you. Her melee moves will deal more DMG than you, and so applies to her alpha as well. However, every skill she does forces a pause on her motion. You can let her lock on a teammate and punish her with alphas. If she locks onto you then punish every missed shot the best you can and stay away from her. If her aim isn't perfect you should win for free, but even if she hits every shot you'll be a super valuable asset to keeping her in check and preventing her from annihilating you and your team with those high DMG alphas.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
If you can roll, this matchup shouldn't be a issue. Simply roll any attempts the enemy makes of landing a beta and punish it with a beta combo of your own or alphas. Keep in mind your gamma hits through his gamma and can catch Mirios off-guard while you delete their health with a combo.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
It's impossible to fight someone you can't hit. Just focus on punishing whiffed betas and gammas, however, don't use your own beta against him. It's far too easy for him to react to your beta so just punish with gamma combos or alpha depending on your location relative to him.
<br>

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Tamaki is a grab character with more HP and mobility than you. He's very hard to take at range as his grab makes it hard to beat him in an interaction. The best you can do is just try and hit alphas and catch him with a beta while he's grounded, but if both of you click beta he will win so catch him when he's not using beta.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Nejire's alpha is capable of trading with yours very well and thanks to the extra speed she now has on Special Action she's a much harder target to hit. This matchup is basically an aim check between you two and you have higher damage while she has easier shots to land. Betas are very hard to land against her so I generally recommend not using beta to try and hit her unless she has no idea your coming.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Shinso has a lot of "lag" on his moves, so you can punish with your alpha any of his options. He's also very prone to wake-up catches with his lack of good wake-up options so catch that weakness. Keep in mind that he can explode your health super fast too and should be taken seriously, but if you fight him with your team you should be able to take him down by punishing his attempts to grab or brainwash with your alpha.
<br>

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Assault All Might has a lot of "laggy" options perfect for punishing with alphas. However his gamma makes quite a good wake-up option, so catching it might be hard, but if you time it right you should still be able to catch his gamma. Just beat him with alphas and there's little he can do to win the alpha trade. If he hits you with beta, wake and then do nothing. You'll take a lot of damage but if he tries to go for another beta he will fly by you allowing you to even the score, and if he doesn't you'll be able to mixup when you go for alpha alpha to knock him back.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Thanks to the massive boost in mobility he got he is now much harder to land shots against and is capable of hitting you for very large amounts of damage from alpha and gamma without much risk anymore. Just try to land shots during his beta and Special Action startup and while he's firing alphas and eventually he will run away or die.

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Aizawa will be able to punish you very hard for almost everything you do, but just keep in mind that if he's comboing a teamate, two clean shots will knock him out of the combo early, and to top it off he might be one of the most prone to wake-up catches in the game so he can't really challenge your beta on wake-up well. If Aizawa goes for alpha pull, melee 1, gamma (which is a common strategy) then spam air melee. You should be able to break the combo on GP after the melee.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Present Mic just out-damages and out-ranges you. Focus on keeping his boomboxes destroyed and don't get close since his beta is very dangerous from up close. Mic can be a easy target for wake-up catches but it can be hard to be in the sweetspot to catch his wake-up due to the worry about his beta, so just stick to alphas here.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Your gamma allows you to easily line up and go over everything Cementoss builds and catch him with alphas. He can't really injure air targets so just be in the air as much as you can or at least above him on a building, and punish attempts to build up with alphas or a beta. Be weary that going for beta will often trade with his alpha's lingering hitbox, so alphas will often be better.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Endevor is capable of out-maneuvering you quite efficiently with his special action and beta. Additionally, his beta is among the only moves in the game capable of winning alpha trades against Full Bullet and simultaneously is a great combo breaker if you try to catch his wake-up in any situation. Your advantage is that he's a big target for alphas and often leaves himself open for shots with his gamma and special action. Be weary of the enemy having Space Hop as thats super common on Endevor. 
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Assault Endeavor lost the match-up-defining beta that Strike Endeavor has, but his Assault counterpart has gained strong aerial tools to attack grounded enemies, which results in large damage against you if he gets to jump you or if you miss a key hit. That said Assault Endeavor leaves himself open a lot, with his beta, gamma, and special action all being quite "laggy" which leads to you being able to alpha spam him quite well. Once again be weary of Space Hop.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>

Hawks can stay quite far from you and is among the part of the cast that wake-up catches with beta often don't work on. However, there is little Hawks can do to beat out your alphas. He also has openings to shoot him if he tries to shoot a gamma or use beta for mobility, since both of those skills have solid "lag" on them. If your aim is strong and you're goot at dodging, then there should be no issues here.

All she has going for her is Giant Mode, but with the recent cooldowm changes even this is rarely that threatening. Her damage in close range is okay, but you can easily outmaneuver her and win even in melee range. Try to stall for time when she grows big by using your I-frames effectively and rolling when needed and you should have no issues. She's not a threat anymore in small mode and while you always won againsy small mode anyways, now she just can't fight back.

Strike Shigaraki is able to punish you for touching the ground quite well with his gamma and additionally can be quite a slippery target when piloted by a good player, but there's a few key issues here, being that Strike Shigaraki has no options against you when you are in the air, and while you are in the beta animation you are not considered to be on the ground when it comes to receiving damage from his alpha and beta. This means that a beta, beta cancel, gamma with 2 Shigaraki alphas underneath you will often only result in 4 ticks of damage maximum, and sometimes lower. That said, never fight Shigaraki indoors without a good reason to. If you're going indoors with him you better have a massive HP lead or you're gonna be in for a tough time.

Assault Shigaraki has the same issue of being unable to hit you in the air, but Assault Shigaraki doesn't suffer from hitting you during your beta animation with his alpha. When fighting Shigaraki try to be in the air or above him in some way and catch his openings with your alpha or beta. He leaves himself really vulnerable when using beta, gamma tap, and to a lesser extent alpha and special action. Be weary of the explosive combos Assault Shigaraki has and you should have no issues. This character is also very prone to wake-up catches with your beta.

It's impossible to know the matchup as he could have a Quirk that just beats you easily. When facing his base kit however just stay grounded and catch his beta and gamma with your alphas. Do not approach him and go for beta here and if he's indoors do not go inside with him.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
The main issue here is that Tech Dabi disrupts your armorless options quite well, and alpha spam against him is also iffy with his traps and gamma blocking them. When Tech Dabi is close to you it can often be surprisingly hard to create space, as his gamma is a fantastic tool for interrupting your gammas and betas. Fortunately, you can kinda often forget about his existence as he doesn't really pose a threat from range, and can't break that gap easily. If you gamma up you can often ignore his gamma wall and shoot him from above, but Tech Dabi is most often found in buildings where this isn't a option or even if he is outdoors, his beta still blocks your alpha. Keep a eye for Wall Runner on dabis too as they very often carry this special tune.

Strike Dabi trades all the defensive utility for offense, but there are many issues with it. Strike Dabi has gained the ability to fight you from a distance, but fortunately he's bad at it, leaving himself perfectly still for some shots, allowing you to easily and consistently win the alpha trade. Strike Dabi's beta also doesn't have much armor until the grab happens, so if he approches. you can jump beta him away. His gamma also leaves him quite open during activation and makes him probably the most prone to wake-up catches in the game since when his gamma hits 0 while he's knocked back, he will be forced to start the burst as soon as he gets back up so he can't be smart with his invincibility frames most of the time. Some well aimed shots and a beta or 2 should take a Strike Dabi down easily.

Thanks to the dev's favoritism she now has near unlimited mobility and more HP than you which lets her constantly reposition until she can catch you in a bad spot and beam you down. Realistically, however, you do still win the alpha trade, you just have to win it every time as you can't really escape her while she can easily escape you.

Rapid Toga can dish out very high burst damage with beta alpha gamma combo, but you can do the same with some alphas so this match-up often comes down to the first hit. Rapid Toga is okay against wake-up catches due to how fast her gamma is but she's extremely bad at disengaging against you since your alpha very easily catches her gamma's endlag, preventing her escape.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Ever since Twice lost his combos, he has since been unable to put up a good fight against anyone. He leaves himself quite open to alphas with Twice's gamma and beta "lag". The only time where you should struggle with Twice is when he has a lot of clones, but even then your beta is capable of hitting multiple clones at once and dealing with them quite efficiently.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Compress is incredibly mobile and still has a strong presence at range. Firing alphas into him is hard due to his beta reflecting your shots for incredibly high return damage. One shot into a Compress beta can mean you take 350 damage if the Compress beta is high enough level. That said you can catch his gamma quite easily with some alphas or a beta depending on range so if the Compress just tries to get away right in front of you punish him and get the KO.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri is able to alpha trade with you, and has some very high damage combos with his beta that he goes for a lot. Kurogiri is also very good at keeping you far away from him, so while his ability to prevent the wake-up catch is bad, it doesn't matter if you never get close enough to begin with. For this match-up it's strongly recommended targeting him first in a team fight due to his revive capability.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Overhaul is very threatening up close because his gamma beats out all your moves up close. You do have significantly more alpha damage, but the main issue here is the gamma. An Overhaul that's good with gamma can prevent you from ever escaping since it also hits and stuns through your wall. Overhaul can also heal himself, which makes this match-up even weirder. Overhaul isn't prone to wake-up catches, and in fact, he catches your wake-ups very easily. Against Overhaul just try to stay farther away from higher ground and win alpha trades, as if he gets too close it can be quite hard to escape.
