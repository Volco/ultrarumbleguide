## Alpha Skill - Dagger Shot

Twice throws a series of knives; each hit slows the target. A great tool for control and starting a combo. Used for distance control, keeping enemies away and slowing them down, as well as a final blow or to finish off those who try to run away. Do not rely too much on this skill, althought it does quite a lot of damage (if you hit with all 3 knives), but be careful when you get closer to the enemy or vice versa. At the moment, due to the nerf to Twice, he cannot stop his alpha skill with his gamma, so you need to be careful with this so as not to get into a situation where you will not dominate.

## Beta Skill - Self Duplicate
<p align="center">

</p>

Twice's beta skill allows him to create a clone that attacks nearby enemies. These clones can only use Alpha or his basic Melee attacks, and they die when hit once (even by non-damaging moves), when using beta again before the clone has died, or when enough time has passed. They can be used as distraction, as with the right spacing and positioning they won't be able to take them down with an AoE attack, meaning they will either have to take clone damage while attacking you, or kill the clone and give you a window to attack them while they aren't attacking you.<br>
<br>
Clones are your hidden ace up your sleeve, so release the clone immediately after entering the battle or to counterattack opponents when you retreat. Sometimes, the clone can even be used as a living shield to hide from enemy shots. Do not release clones into nowhere, wait for a convenient moment, and when in battle, summon the clone mid combo to create pressure. It should also be noted that the clone summoning itself does damage.<br>
<br>
Be aware that beta clones do not follow you, they move at random until they find an enemy.

## Gamma Skill - Foot Boost
<p align="center">

</p>

Twice's gamma skill is a short-ranged rapid dash forward on a measuring tape that stuns the opponent for a second enabling basic combos, and brings you closer to them. Some usages are to start the battle first and fly into the enemy, or to quickly escape enemy fire in an unfavorable situation, as this skill is Twice's mobility. Keep in mind though that this mobility option is slow, so unless you can fly behind obstacles, you will likely get beamed down to death if you dare to use it as such in the open.

## Special Action - Mud Imitation
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch037.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Twice's Special Action allows him to, through a DOWNd enemy, kill them and create a clone of the enemy. These clones can use alpha, beta, gamma and melees, but not their special action. They also follow you around, unlike beta clones, and can also use the tuning of the cloned enemy, or even be interacted with like a normal teammate, which is to say that you can carry them with carry skills such as Kendo's or Compress's Special Actions, or be healed through Support Ability Cards or Overhaul's special action. Unlike beta clones, these have HP (though not GP), so they can survive a few hits. Special Action clones can die after losing all their HP or if the original player from whom you created the clone has been revived, which in the endgame can tell you if one of the few remaining enemies has revived their teammate.<br>
<br>
A powerful part of Twice's kit is building an army of Special Action clones, since they can easily kill a careless enemy with their aimbot alphas and overall cause lots of destruction. You can have up to 6 active Special Action clones at one, creating a 7th will kill the 1st. You also should choose which people to clone if able to choose, overall you want clones that can be really disruptive to enemies like All For One for his gamma or Shinso/Aizawa due to being a grab character and immobilizing the enemy, and overall characters that help you in battle a lot and don't need their Special Action to be strong.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 3-hit string combo that shines by its range on its first hit, allowing you to hit people that are a bit farther away than the average melee range, useful to trigger melee tunes such as Acceleration or Embrittlement.

## Leveling Paths
### PC Path
For people with good aim.

### Old Reliable Path
Unfortunately with alpha no longer comboing, beta is the best tool to end gamma strings.

### Carlmain Path
A path to pelt people with alphas and just let the clone do the work.

### Balanced Path
A solid mix here if you intend to play twice in what's probably the most optimal way.

### Gamma -> Gamma
Used to quickly reach a target or a sharp break with two consecutive dashes.

</p>

### Gamma -> Beta
A great option for an aggressive attack: a quick dash, then calling a clone to continue the pressure.
