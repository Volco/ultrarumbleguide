Hawks are birds of prey of the family Accipitridae. They are very widely distributed and are found on all continents, except Antarctica.

The subfamily Accipitrinae includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, sharp-shinned hawks, and others. This subfamily are mainly woodland birds with short broad wings, long tails, and high visual acuity. They hunt by dashing suddenly from a concealed perch.

In the United States, members of the Buteo group are also called hawks, though birds of this group are called buzzards in other parts of the world. Generally, buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger-winged and shorter-tailed than accipiters, and fly further distances in open areas. Buteos descend or pounce on their prey rather than engaging in fast, horizontal pursuit.

## Alpha Skill - Wingbeat

<p align="center">

</p>

Hawks' alpha skill allows him to shoot homing feathers that follow the enemy. These feathers are a bit slow and easy for your opponent to dodge in a 1v1, but it can be a tricky annoyance as a 3rd party tool or as means of placing pressure onto the opponent. They're also very useful when dealing with airborne targets, especially slower ones like Nejire or characters running away in a straight line.<br>
<br>
In aim mode, your feathers lose their tracking ability, but they also become much faster, they stay clumped together, and gain extra range, which makes them your main option for ranged damage. Landing his aimed alpha consistently requires you to be quite decent at aiming, and also limits your mobility, as you can't move much while aiming, so it's recommended to use aiming mode in the middle of a jump, while falling, or after gamma to keep yourself in motion. The unaimed version doesn't suffer as much from this issue since it can be paired with his Special Action to shoot while moving.

## Beta Skill - Wind Cross
<p align="center">

</p>

Hawks' beta skill allows him to dash at the aimed direction. When hitting an enemy with it he will enter Free Flight mode for the duration of the skill, which allows him to fly in any direction. Pressing this skill again while in Free Flight mode will make Hawks perform a Free Flight Slash, becoming faster for a split second and dealing damage. This skill can be cancelled by holding it, though it has some endlag, so be mindful of that.<br>
<br>
This is Hawks' main source of damage, slashing through opponents as he flies. In order for this move to be properly use, you must quickly turn your camera around after landing the initial dash and perform a Free Flight Slash, this is done to take advantage of the initial hit's stun, by turning your camera around you can quickly dash back with a Free Flight Slash while they're stunned, allowing you to guarantee one hit after the dash. This skill's damage area has a surprisingly generous lingering on its slash, which means that even if you slash a bit too early, you might still hit the enemy. Each use of this skill will take 50% of the gauge, meaning it can only be used twice before it goes on cooldown, however, landing it resets the percentage back at 100%, and will consume it as you fly, taking around 20% for each Free Flight Slash. Cancelling the skill uses the whole gauge. It's also worth noting that this skill's initial dash has very good tracking, which makes it quite easier to land.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300b-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>
<br>
Beta can also be used as mobility. Due to the fact you can use it twice before it goes on cooldown, you can use one dash to get closer to the top of a building, and/or if needed, hit the dash to enter Free Flight mode and fly away when your Special Action is on cooldown, however this latter case isn't recommended, as the move is slow and easy to dodge, meaning they can easily punish you to death (which you might be close to if you need to run away in the first place.)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300b2-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>
Be mindful of how and when you use this ability, as its cooldown is quite high.

## Gamma Skill - Storm Wings
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch043_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Hawks' gamma skill allows him to shoot out a huge feather projectile that does damage, but also makes a quick non-damaging AoE that on impact applies the Marked effect, allowing you and your team to see the marked enemies through walls for a few seconds, which comes handy to track down an opponent or let your team quickly know their location. This skill has a held variation, where by holding it the damaging projectile will travel faster and you will gain recoil, sending you back in the opposite direction, useful to keep some distance from the enemy.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300y-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300y2-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300y5-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

The held variation can also be used for mobility. If you shoot it downwards, you will be pushed upwards, which you can use to propel yourself closer to the top of a building. You can also shoot it behind you to propel yourself forward. This ability keeps yourself mobile and leaves you in a good position to shoot some aimed alphas.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300y3-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300y4-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

Overall this skill is great when it comes to utility, it's your best option for burst mobility and vertical movement, allowing you to save beta charges you'd use for mobility while also providing very good damage and a temporary wallhack for you and your team.

## Special Action #1 - Fierce Wings: Flight
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch043_2.png" width="400" />
</p>

Hawks' special action allows him to fly when dashing midair. Unlike beta's Free Flight mode, you cannot move up or down, meaning it's useless for vertical movement but amazing for horizontal one. Activating this skill costs you 25% of your gauge at minimum (technically a bit less but your brief flight will always take 5%), so be mindful to not abuse this skill in small bursts because the activation cost is somewhat strict, and the cooldown isn't forgiving either, it's actually pretty long. If you're just gonna use it to move around, it's better to keep it in small bursts so long as you don't abuse this. You can also press the special action button to make Hawks fly faster at the cost of some extra gauge.<br>
<br>
This ability is really good for a few reasons, the obvious one is that it allows you to fly away from danger, it's so fast that most of the time people won't even bother following you, as they gotta have very good mobility to properly chase you. This ability is also considered a Passive Special Action (not the case for pressing the button to make him fly faster though), meaning it can be used without cancelling your i-frames, the Critical Permeation and Quasi-Permeation special tunes, or even to fly away from an area before the match start countdown is over. All these factors make it one of the best if not the best skill for disengaging and run away from the enemy when the safe zone is still big, as catching your wake-ups becomes nearly impossible. For these reasons, it's important to manage your Special Action's gauge and avoid using it for the smallest thing, especially considering Hawks has other mobility options.<br>
<br>
In the late game it loses much of its function as a runaway tool due to the small size of the safe zone, but you can still use it to avoid wake-up catches, get away from a bad position, or simply to keep yourself mobile.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300s2-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - Fierce Wings: Transport
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch043_1.png" width="400" />
</p>

When approaching and ally, you can use your Special Action on them to carry them flying. While being carried, allies can still use  their skills, however if they use a skill that roots them in place like all of Ibara's skills, then they'll dismount. Unlike the other version of his Special Action, this one does allow you to ascend and descent using the jump and crouch inputs respectively. Not everyone benefits from the carrying mechanic, Technical Kaminari is probably the character that makes best use of it, being able to shoot homing bolts from the sky and essentially turning you two into a fighter jet. This ability can also be used to carry low mobility characters, either to chase an enemy without leaving your ally alone, or to carry them to safety when they're low, but keep in mind that this variation isn't as fast, even though it consumes less gauge. Your best bet to give this variation a good use is with a pre-made team, preferrably with voice communication, as random teammates might screw your plans and dismount.<br>
<br>
Always make sure to check your Special Action gauge to keep track of how much you have left.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 3-hit string combo. Hawks' ground melees are quite good, the lunge on the first two parts makes it easy to reach opponents that normally you wouldn't reach with the melees of most other characters. This in turn makes it very annoying, as you can stay away from your target's melee range but still connect with yours. It also serves as a bit of burst mobility in the first two hits, which can be useful when paired with gamma and can be used to throw people's aim off while going around a corner.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Hawks' air melee isn't too special, it has two instances of damage, if you manage to hit both, it's decent damage. The utility of this tool is almost entirely linked to Hawks' Special Action, as it's used to cancel it for mobility and combos.

## Leveling Paths
### Aggressive Path: Rush
An aggressive path that focuses on beta without neglecting gamma, placing alpha as a secondary need.

</p>

### Aggressive Path: Balanced
Similar to the previous path, but instead of rushing to Beta Level 9, Hawks is kept more balanced in his options with Alpha Level 4.

### Support Path: Rush
An alternative path focused on support, where gamma is the priority instead of beta, quickly unlocking the 3rd gamma and its maximum size.

## Techs
### Forward Cut
Hawks' can cancel his solo Special Action by performing an Air Melee, this will keep his momentum, allowing him to fall with a lot of forward momentum and reaching farther than he normally would, as well as avoiding falling in a straight line and waste time that could potentially be punished. This can also be used for combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300t1-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

### Flightless Beta
Normally, if your beta lands on an enemy, you will enter Free Flight mode, and this can normally not be avoided. However, there is a sweet spot between missing beta and landing it where you can hit the initial dash but you won't enter Free Flight mode. Overall, this isn't really useful to the average player and it's extremely difficult to pull in an actual match against targets in motion, as the sweet spot requires very strict spacing, but if you somehow are able to pull this reliably, then you've got yourself a useful combo tool to pump extra damage.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4300t2-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Hawks' abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 50 DP 
Beta Skill: 100 DP (Dash), 500 DP (Slash)<br>
Gamma Skill: 100 DP<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3: ? DP (Individually), 500 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: ? DP (125 or less)<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Gamma -> Alpha Spam
A basic combo that makes use of Gamma's speed and stun to guarantee a few alphas.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/basic-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Air Melee -> Beta (Dash) -> Beta (Slash)
A strong and moderately easy to execute combo, with the only downside being that most of the time it will require the use of Special Action to pull of the Air Melee. You gotta be quick with beta or else the enemy won't be affected by it due to i-frames.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta (Dash) -> Gamma -> Beta (Dash) -> Beta (Slash)
Hawks' current strongest combo, albeit one extremely hard to perform due to the usage of the Flightless Beta tech.
