Neito Monoma is a character than can do anything, and everything, from having extreme mobility by using his beta or by refreshing his own skills, a gamma that makes him invincible, and a rather long ranged alpha with consistent damage. His main mechanic is the ability to copy the quirk abilities of teammates and both copy and mix various quirk abilities from enemies, allowing him to have all kinds of combinations, both weak combinations and extremely strong ones, which can make it hard for the enemy to know what to expect.

## Alpha Skill - Big Fist (Copy)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch104_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Monoma gets a giant hand like Kendo’s to shoot out shockwaves. Despite the giant hand, it actually doesn’t have a hitbox and only the shockwaves fired from it doing any damage. This move has very little downpower, meaning you’ll never be knocking anyone down with alpha alone unless they’ve already taken some damage from other skills. Holding the button continuously fires out the shockwaves<br>
<br>
This ability can copy the enemy's alpha skill thanks to Monoma's special action, and even though you can hold it, it can be better to just tap it if you purely want to copy someone’s quirk as other characters could get in the way. If no one else is around, it’s safer to hold alpha to get more damage off of them while also letting you get their alpha.<br>
<br>
Something to note is that this move has VERY long range. Even though its range is long, the copy distance isn’t equal to the range of the attack. Your attacks may land, but you might not copy the target. Do not worry too much about this though as this rarely happens.<br>
<br>
There’s also a bug where using beta or gamma right after landing the shockwave with alpha can cause you not to copy anything. Try to slightly delay your moves if you’re worried about this, but if you fire more than one alpha at someone you should be fine.<br>
<br>

## Beta Skill - Gyrate (Copy)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch104_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Monoma dashes towards the opponent, but if used on the ground he starts by jumping in the air and knocking opponents up with his knee before doing the dash<br>
<br>
This is Monoma’s mobility move, taking you quite a good distance. You’ll often see Monoma’s using this move over and over via Cooldown Resetting (more on that later) for incredible mobility to escape every situation, or get high in the sky to rain down chaos.<br>
<br>
Aside from mobility, this move is very effective at being used for attacking others, especially at catching wake ups. Using beta on the ground to start the knee attack right as an opponent gets up can oftentimes let you land a hit with the follow up dash due to the great tracking of the move.<br>
<br>
This ability copies the target's beta skill upon landing it.<br>
<br>

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Steel (Copy)

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch104_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Monoma turns his body to steel and becomes INVINCIBLE. However, his invincibility ends whenever he uses any of his quirk skills, the gauge reaches 0%, or when hit by an attack. <br>
<br>
Upon being hit, you copy the gamma of whoever hit you while also gaining brief i-frames. This move is absolutely insane and can save you from lots of skills that could lead you into your death. The only stuns that still bypass the armor given on the skill are Present Mic’s beta and grabs (however you are protected from the initial first grab hit).<br>
<br>
Even a non-damaging move easily proves to be one of his most useful skills. The move's cooldown is also insanely short at high levels. Spamming it mid fight while using his base kit greatly enhances survivability during fights.<br>
<br>
Finally, there is an interaction with his gamma where if you’re hit by another Monoma, the gamma only ends. The move's percentage is not consumed, as if you were hit by another character. This allows you to IMMEDIATELY use gamma again, giving you the upper hand in defense against other Monomas while they use copied quirks.<br>
<br>
<p align="center">

## Special Action #1 - Skill Switch

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch104_2.png" width="400" />
</p>
This is how Monoma switches between his base kit and copied quirks. This is what separates the average Monoma from the rest, all depending on how you use it. Switching quirks refreshes ALL cooldowns. This is how you’ll often see Monoma’s being in the air forever. A Mirio alpha that would normally require you to land on the ground to reload can be refreshed instantly by just switching twice. This makes Monoma really powerful.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10400s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - Scanners

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch104/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch104_1.png" width="400" />
</p>
Holding the special action button with a teammate in sight makes you dash towards them to copy their alpha, beta, and gamma. This overrides any copied quirks you currently have, so it’s not optimal to use if you have quirks on hand already that you want to keep.

The special action is also very good if you have more mobile teammates. For example, if you have a Mirio using alphas for mobility, using his special on him repeatedly gives you mobility without having to use any quirks! 

There’s a bug where quirks copied with gamma are sometimes level 1. This can be fixed by getting a different gamma from being hit, copying a teammate, or leveling up your gamma.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
A 2-hit string combo chain. Monoma’s melees aren’t all that, not doing the greatest damage. They combo much better with his base kit. However, doing the first hit of melee twice into any move ever is a very good combo. 
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/10400m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
Monoma's air melee is a simple kick. Other than being the fastest air melee to spam while falling, it doesn't have much to it.

## Leveling Paths
### Duplicate Path
This leveling path is when you simply want to function like the teammate you’re mainly copying. Let’s say for example, you have a Mr. Compress as a teammate. If you plan to mainly just copying him, maxing alpha first is your best bet. Basically for this type of leveling path, think like you’re not Monoma, but your main copy target.

Alternatively, this doesn’t apply to just teammate quirks. If you copy the quirks of another character you don’t want to lose, continue to level up like you’re that character in the same way.

</p>

### Generalist Path
For this leveling path, your goal is to get everything to level 4, and then from there, you should be able to make sub-decent use of any characters quirks you find. If you like to switch up quirks a lot, this is the best path. Continue to level up your quirks evenly for maximum efficiency, increasing all of their levels by 1

</p>

### Weird Path
This is probably the strangest level path. Similar to the Generalist Path, but it goes quite differently after the basics.
You might think maxing gamma is crazy, especially over main offense moves. However, a max level gamma before your offense moves can be good for playing more defensively. As stated in the gamma description, it’s quite the spammable move in conjunction with his base kit. While it’s a bit riskier because gamma skills of characters are often the least consistent ones compared to alphas and betas.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
Strike Slots: Present Mic > Beta/Alpha DMG > HP DMG > GP DMG > Gamma DMG<br>
Try to stay away from too much gamma damage tunings because his base kit gets nothing out of them. Some things to note is that Present Mic’s strike tune gives special action reload, being one of the things Monoma loves,

Assault Slots: Endeavor > Young AFO > All Might > Almost anything else<br>
Assault Endeavor is the best assault normal tuning, giving a damage boost to shields and a defense to your HP. You can have Young AFO tune over any of the other [X] move defense due to the plus ultra and plus chaos reload. You can put this one over All Might’s because his HP is a bit low, so he doesn’t get the defense as much as other characters.

Rapid Slots Slots: Twice > Toga > Mirio > Bakugo > Anything else<br>
Twice with the beta reload is what you want the most. Sting Dance Toga gives you the gamma reload (though faster beta is better), and Mirio’s gives you alpha reload. Bakugo has the attack power increase, but as stated in the strike section, gamma attack power isn’t the best (not like there’s a better rapid tune though). Truly unfortunate how you may end up using a tune of class 1-A.

Support Slots: Kurogiri > Overhaul > Shiozaki > Momo > Compress > Cementoss<br>
Kurogiri is above Overhaul here because Monoma once again gets lower benefit from gamma attack power compared to other characters. Compress and Cementoss are not good, so try and avoid them. If you have to go with one, use Mr. Compress.

Technical Slots: All for One > Shoto > Mirio > Nejire > Whatever else is needed<br>
All for One’s tune is the best for Monoma, giving HP as well as some special action reload. Beta reload is what Monoma likes the most. You can prioritize beta reloads over sheer counter and Nejire if you want, but if you want a more generalist build, you can use Sheer Counter Mirio and Nejire for the gamma reload. 

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br> There is no reason you wouldn't want this. This tuning is useful, even at lower levels. It can save you from getting combo’d further after being guard broken.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder** <br>Depending on your teammate or if you can get a mobility quirk, Kota finder can be good, albeit more situational. An option for a strike special tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Arguably one of the best tunings in the game. Combined with the vast amount of characters that are good with it, Monoma would get just as much value. One of his best picks if not the best for an Assault slot.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch007_01.png" width="125"> | **Electrification** <br>Another choice for a technical slot. Monoma can very easily proc this with his base kit. Using his beta to guardbreak someone can end in them being stunned. Even without using his base kit, Monoma has tons of way to guardbreak, and depending on his moves, get the electrification off.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Another option for a strike slot. Even at lower levels, this tuning can be great all around. Whether you need a burst of damage, speed, or defense, this tuning is great.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>A wonderful strike special tuning. Monoma is very much able to escape some situations. After your I-frames end with willpower, activate your gamma and dodge like your life depends on it (it does). His gamma will basically be a 2nd willpower, letting you survive another hit. Definitely one of the better tunings for him. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Rapid special tunes aren't really all that great for Monoma, but out of the ones available, this is a solid choice for getting levels with KOs.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch018_01.png" width="125"> | **GP Sucker** <br>Another rapid slot option that can't go wrong, replenishing some GP after downing somebody.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support** <br>No support special tune is super great on Monoma, whoever Revenge Support is one of those tunes that work generally well on everyone. This is mostly optimal at higher levels, and is not recommended as a budget option. Monoma can stall out revenge support to get more heals of it by using his gamma and playing defensively to recover more HP.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Another support slot option to open large boxes faster. Anyone can really use it if they got decent mobility.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>An assault slot option. This one is mixed. Monoma can’t really cooldown reset anymore, but this tuning makes him reload very fast which can essentially help you get your special action back faster as long as you’re not air stalling. If you find yourself switching often, it might not be for you.|

As for the rapid slot here, PU Turbo is the best option as the 5% plus ultra gain per down makes sure you always get value from it.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-hero.png" width="30"> |

It doesn’t last as long, but even at level 1 it can be a life saver. The second slot is a villain slot, and the most optimal one is Compression Magic as the others only get value at higher levels.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-villain.png" width="30"> |
