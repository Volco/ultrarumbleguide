In this sub-guide you'll learn to make use of the Poison Mist to your advantage! As well as important data related to it.

# Introduction: A Strategic Element of Life and Death
The Poison Mist is an incredibly valuable strategic element, and learning how to take full advantage from it will be key to survive, as paradoxical as it might sound. The mist can be used both in the offense and the defense, but it's morst common usage is on the defense. One thing you must learn about the mist if you are a new-ish player is to not be deeply afraid of it. It's encouraged to "feel" the mist and get familiar with its damage and how much you're able to do inside of it.<br>

# The Poison Mist: Repositioning and Safe Pockets

The first defensive use of the Poison Mist (and also the safest) is to not treat it like an absolute wall, and instead, go inside and exit it from another point. This can be useful when the mist has engulfed part of a building, where if you go inside the mist you can access the stairs that lead to the second floor and leave the mist in this second floor. Many new players (and sometimes even the average player) treat the mist like an absolute wall, which leaves them in a vulnerable and cornered position when attacked sometimes, however, if you're able to run away to a safer place by briefly entering the Poison Mist, do it.

Sometimes, depending on where the mist stops, there might be tiny gaps between buildings and the mist's edges that are barely big enough to fit a player without making you take poison DMG. If the final circle is chaotic, finding these spots can be a blessed healing spot, since most people won't try to go into such a tiny space if they don't need to heal.

# The Poison Mist: Retreat and Aggro Cancelling

When a player is injured, the common response is to find a place to heal and drink healing items, however, this is not always possible, due to a crowded final circle or a team/enemy focusing you. When this occurs, you can either use mobility skills to make yourself hard to hit until you find a healing spot, or you can retreat to the Poison Mist. The mist does damage every second, which makes it a dangerous place to stay in, more so the further into a match you are, however, people usually prefer to avoid going inside, which is why it can often be a good healing spot. If you keep taking HP Drinks, you can extend your survival in the Poison Mist for as long as you have HP drinks. If you have low HP, you should drink small drinks until you have enough HP to drink a large one, after which you can attempt to take a GP drink and try your best to keep your HP high enough until you leave the mist. This can be resource heavy in some occasions, but it's better than dying.

Full Support Drinks (the ones that recover all HP and GP for you and the team) come incredibly handy for this, as they allow you to regenerate your GP and HP at the same time, making it so you don't have to worry about replenishing the HP you lost while taking the GP drink. Another useful item for Poison Mist retreats are Support Ability Cards, as those can heal you pasively, buying you more time to drink healing items that otherwise you wouldn't have enough time to.

Depending on who you're facing, some teams or players might casually chase you inside the Poison Mist (this is especially common early game, where it does little damage, but it still happens in late game), but if you have support ability cards and/or delay your wake-up as much as possible (through a ground wake-up), you make your character slowly get up while taking no poison DMG, but the enemy will be taking poison DMG the whole time, making it risky for them to continue fighting and retreat (though some people might still fight, even if it gets them killed). Some teams might have characters that can resurrect teammates, these can be dangerous as the consequences of their teammates perishing in the mist are lower than usual.

If you feel your enemy is the kind to really insist and pressure, you might want to refuge deeper into the Poison Mist, or simply take an unpredictable path. If possible, look at the minimap and look at the location the safe zone will move to, that way if you happen to die or get downed, the safe zone will come to you and it will be safer and easier for teammates to help you out or get your badge if you die.

Keep in mind that this strategy works pretty well for 350-400 HP characters, but is terrible for 225-250 HP ones. Poison DMG is fixed, it's not a percentage, so characters with less base HP will die sooner.

# The Poison Mist: Safe Death

If you don't see yourself surviving, try to die inside the Poison Mist, specifically in the direction the safe zone will go. This can sometimes be useful since dying in the safe zone will expose your loot to the enemy, but dying inside the Poison Mist can potentially discourage the enemy from looking too much into your dead body (if at all), so your revive cards can stay there for your teammate to pick them up and revive you.

# The Poison Mist: Extended Survival and Camping

A tactic that is often frowned upon (mostly if only 2 teams remain alive) is "Storm Camping", a strategy where you attempt to survive in the Poison Mist for as long as possible through Support Ability Cards, your HP drinks, and the HP drinks on the ground from people that have been KOd. While Storm Camping, you will be in a "safe" position where players won't usually target you, as you will often be too far away to be even noticed. This can be useful in crowded circles or when facing people that you know will erase you, or simply if you need to revive your teammates and are looking for a good chance to do so, you could even revive them inside the Poison Mist if doing so inside the safe zone looks too risky.

Sometimes you might be forced to stay for a long while, either because you're trying to get the badge of a teammate that died really deep into the Poison Mist, or to avoid being targeted by a specific team as soon as you come back in.

# The Poison Mist: Surviving A Closed Circle - The Absolute End of a Match

As the match progresses, the safe zone gets smaller, and eventually, it will close, leaving only Poison Mist behind, acting as a way to forcefully kill players. 
There are two ways of surviving this part: Outresource the Enemy or Kill Them

The most common end to a circle closure (especially in solos) is healing oneself until they either run out of healing items or the enemy does. If you're playing a character with less than Base 300 HP, you won't have enough time to drink a large HP drink, but if you have 300 or more and start drinking as soon as you can while full health, you will be able to survive off large HP drinks (small ones are too weak to outpace the Poison Mist's damage). Something not many people realize is that aside from healing items or fighting the last enemy, there are more ways to influence the outcome of the endgame. When the safe zone closes, the Poison Mist does 40 DMG per second, this means:

- 225 HP characters will be DOWNd in 6 seconds.
- 250 HP characters will be DOWNd in 7 seconds.
- 300 HP characters will be DOWNd in 8 seconds.
- 350 HP characters will be DOWNd in 9 seconds.
- 400 HP characters will be DOWNd in 10 seconds.

When a character is DOWNd, they will have 400 Down HP regardless of their base HP, but this has an interesting twist. The Poison Mist takes 10 seconds to kill a DOWNd player, however, because 400 divided by 40 is exactly 10, that means that if you had just one extra Down HP, you'd be able to survive for an extra second. By equipping either Mr. Compress's or Strike Hawks's normal tuning you will be able to survive 11 seconds in the final Poison Mist. Theoretically you could extend this to 12 but the means to do so (Fixer) aren't worth the investment.

If your costume has green slots, you might equip HP+ normal tunes such as Overhaul's or Ibara's, these are important too, as on 400 HP characters it will allow them to survive for 11 seconds instead of 10 before being DOWNd, which combined with the Down HP normal tuning will allow you to survive for a total of 2 extra seconds. This can also be applied to 350 HP characters, however doing this for 350 HP characters without a very specific and optimized build will result in a bit of a waste for something so situational.

An alternative approach to the safe zone closing is to fight the enemy. If only one enemy remains, you should attempt to attack them with low downpower moves to avoid triggering knockdown onto them, as that will give them i-frames to avoid taking some Poison DMG, instead you want to do as much damage as possible and be the one knocked down to gain time and let the mist do its job. If you have Plus Ultra you can also use its animation to give you an extra second of survival.
