Himiko Toga is a technical character, which means your gameplan revolves around cycling and managing quirk cooldowns.

Where Toga differs from the other two copy characters (AFO and Monoma) is in that her complexity comes from essentially playing a whole different character and knowing how, when or if to use their abilities in a situation then swapping back to Toga at the right moments.

She is incredibly flexible and can do a lot because her presence alone can turn a fight in your favor by taking advantage of your opponents' advantages. Doing well with her is all about keeping your momentum and being on top of your decisions in the heat of battle. Whether it be scouting for a revive character to keep stock of their blood to help your own teammates or to copy an AoE character to flush out areas and split people up or even to duel someone on the same character you're confident you can play better and beat in a fight.

Toga is a character that wants to stick on to and bother one target to toy with and disrupt their attention. She shines when ambushing, being a nuisance and focusing on punishing bad plays from others - whether it be aerial targets who can't dodge your attacks, someone getting too close and entering your beta's range, catching people unaware and shooting them down with alpha or landing a gamma during the end lag of a whiffed attack all while feeling cute doing it.</br>

## Alpha Skill - Jagged Throwing Knife 
<p align="center">

Technical Toga doesn't have the strongest base kit so to use her to the best of you ability you should invest in alpha. It's where her best DPS comes from, has very far range and one of the best fire rates. It also is a beamer alpha meaning it does not knock opponents down easy, taking 20 shots before doing so.

It starts at 16 ammo at level 1 and goes to 30 at level 9. The reload is 0.5 seconds and even the penalty isn't long so you'll likely have this up whenever you need it. Bare in mind that while shooting Toga's movement is restricted and cannot jump or dash so if you want to move faster while using alpha it's important to time your strafing like: Jump left -> shoot a bit -> once you're about to land stop shooting to dash/jump again -> repeat.

The cooldown is very fast and forgiving so you should never worry about it and be very liberal with how you use it. Be mindful of not using it in moments beta would be the better option. To get the most out of it you need to know when to spray just a little or to hold the button longer which will be distinguished below.

She can excel and use this at any range but your approach will differ depending on distance.<br>

**Close Range**<br>
Ideally you don't want to alpha in close range against a lot of the cast on fair grounds or a 1v1, you should use it for kiting, duking, chasing to confirm a kill and punishing committal attacks and heavy end lag moves like for example a Shinso who's mid alpha attack on someone else, but never use this predictably, especially when against a character that has better burst damage than you or a stun/way of locking you down as it's usually a bluff you can do once you've conditioned them to be scared of you, the aim is to either kill in the moment or make them panic and run, forcing them into mid or long range which toga prefers. This gets the most use when your teammate is locked down by a stationary opponent or to 3rd party unaware targets. 

**Mid Range**<br>
This is her preferred "alpha war" range but outside of air strafing to the sides while shooting she doesn't have the best mobility while using it and this is why some matchups she shouldn't take if she can't out-aim them. Generally at this distance you want to shoot at melee characters who you out-range and anyone in their move's end lag. You can trade alphas with other beamers at this range but against higher skilled players it's not advised to do this on fair grounds and make sure you have the advantage first before doing so.

**Long Range**<br>
This is her safest distance and what she wants often, it's mainly for poking and preparing someone for a KO by whittling them down a bit so that when they bring the fight to you they'll be at a disadvantage, or to butter them up for you or your teammates to kill. She can survey and scout potential threats at this range. Her target priority at this range is generally just anyone she can hit in line of sight but ideally it goes Low HP/healing people > Someone running away > 3rd party someone fighting > everyone else. 

A general aiming tip that may or may not apply if you have aim assist is that despite the fast fire rate you still need to lead your shots when shooting afar since it's a projectile and not hitscan (the latter being hitting immediately where your crosshair is.)

All this to say that it's a very weak skill when not leveled to at least level 4 as the size increases help a significant amount.

## Beta Skill - Slasher Killer Knife
<p align="center">

</p>

Toga's beta is a skill with good versatility being good for damage and really shines as her mobility. This is the skill you probably can get away with leveling up last most of the time, but that's playstyle dependent and you can find success with maxing it out first, but it's suggested pairing it with at least level 4 alpha and level 7 gamma. Beta is her riskiest move to get value out of so decision-making when you use this is important, but thankfully it's a rare instance of a skill that recharges while in use so it's forgiving on that front. It's recommended to not depend on this as your sole damage however, because it can be react-able and out-damaged while leaving you with less charges to run away.

It comes with 2 charges and stays the same at all levels. Along with the damage increases it gets 2 size increases at level 4 and level 9. There are two parts to this skill - the initial lunge and the run.

The lunge is a two hit slash combo and has decent tracking while Toga moves in the direction of where you're aiming. The run happens if you hold the button anytime after the lunge and it has a fixed duration unless you hit someone during it, which then time extends as long as you keep hitting people with it. The run has 500 downpower meaning it is an instant knockdown on hit so to get use out of the length it's preferable to hit multiple people and cycle through them as they get knocked down and recover. If you want to end it early you can let go of the button and toga will stop regardless of which state you're in.

</p>

**For Attacking**<br>
Toga's beta had a damage buff semi recently that reverted the nerf it got some seasons ago so it's much more viable for damage now but as a non armored move it still has risks and is best used for punishing people that whiff an attack, catching wake ups on characters who can't beat it, punishing people getting too close so you can run away then reposition or in detransform combos to maximize damage. It also has a quirk of hitting twice if the target rolled during your beta hitting them but don't get used to it happening often since it's out of your control.

**For Mobility**<br>
A lot of your vertical movement will come from jumping, aiming and using the lunge (taping the button) upwards to usually get on top of buildings and map geometry easier
The run is incredibly good at being tricky and swerving around nooks and crannies around the map when trying to lose people chasing you and pairs well after mobility charges of other characters' blood you use, most effective when used in the air so you can have options for pathing.

## Gamma Skill - Blood Sucker (Syringes)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch018_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Toga's arguably most important move and momentum starter but currently it's not advised to depend on it for your base Toga damage. It is a level hungry skill too meaning that you also can't neglect leveling it up if you want to maximize what you get out of it, get it to level 7-9 as early as possible as that's when it gets its last range increase. It deals decent damage at level 9 if all the syringes land but it can be unreliable as it's prone to missing due to obstacles, bad tracking, lag and your target's burst mobility. 

She has 2 charges at all levels to compensate for the troublesome tracking. Landing any of the syringe needles on an opponent will give Toga their blood for her to access with her Special Action. The move also has an interesting quirk where you can have only the blood sucking register but not the damage if the target rolled at the right timing.

Using gamma to the best of your ability is all about timing (and gambling). It has some notable end lag so it's not a good idea to use the move carelessly in 1v1s or at every open target the second you see them, so it's important to know how to pick and choose according to the situation. It also does not track targets well through objects or bushes. This is a quirk that likes to be used in open areas of the map as that gives the least obstructions. 

The best times to use gamma are: while you are in the air, during your opponent's end lag on one of their moves whether it be an attack or at the end of their mobility skill, if someone is stationary, or someone unaware like while looting or in another fight, during a teammate's grab or stun like strike Shigaraki gamma or Denki's Gamma for example and in selective instances as a detransform combo finisher.

A niche usage of it is to gamma people while you're stalking them to safely test which version of a character, default or skill set, you're fighting. Once you get blood the icon will tell you which role they are so you can then plan accordingly.

</p>

## Special Action #1 - Transform
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch018_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Toga's special is the most important part of her kit and what her gameplan comes back to. To transform once you get blood you press the special button and to detransform you press crouch twice quickly. You can act immediately after detransforming.

Transforming has many reasons such as using another character's strengths that toga can take advantage of like AoE characters to control space, revive characters to keep your team alive, mobile characters either to chase or run and so on. She also can transform and detransform quickly to reset her own cooldowns if staying as base toga is preferable in that situation.

A lot of the difficulty in playing her comes from knowing how to play other characters efficiently. It's recommended you have a good understanding on how to play the whole roster but you don't have to master them all. When looking to transform you should value how confident you are in playing the character over just their strength, I advise having 3-6 characters in your pocket that you play well and play reliably to get the most use out of them.

The biggest double-edged sword however is that the enemy you copy and their team have you highlighted so you can use it to your advantage and confuse them but in practice it's easy to point to you and single out who's who, this is why unless the character you copy is good at handling multiple people or you can escape from them it's not advisable to transform if you have a whole team's attention on you- instead try do so during chaos and diversions like 3rd partying or your teammates taking attention if your aim is to disorientate people. Another option is to kill that person and use their blood in a fight with another team so you get the benefit of transforming without being traceable. Just don't forget that while you're transformed, your location is visible at all times by the team you stole blood from.

Lastly, Toga generally would prefer to play transformations out as long as she can before detransforming due to below average dps on her kit outside of alpha but don't get too attached to your blood either and detransform if you have to.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1800s2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - Blood Sucker (Direct-Drinking)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch018_1.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Toga has a second special action that's a stab that can be used on downed bodies, it gives you their blood and puts your Special Action on a short cooldown. It won't see a lot of use unless you were struggling to get the blood with gamma.

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A simple 3-hit melee on the ground that has short range but good speed. You won't be in the position to use this a lot of the time as Toga wants to keep distance but it is a good wake-up catching tool and you can time each press a little slower to account for when your opponent's i-frames end. This also combos well into beta and with the addition of tuning it doesn't hurt to know some detransform into melee combos.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1800m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

A simple 1 hit slash in the air that probably gets better use as mobility aid than as an attack. Using it after a jump can increase your travel distance slightly but when really high up it's useful for air strafing.

## Leveling Paths
### Early Fighter Path A
If you're in the position where you or a teammate are in a fight almost immediately this is what you go for if you need to scrounge up levels fast.

</p>

### Early Fighter Path B
Same reasoning as the previous path but if you need to fight someone you want to stay close to, keep from acting and repeatedly knocking them down.

### Zoning Demon Path A
A solid default to go to for covering your bases. Alpha for poking and damage, Beta for getting people off you and gamma for fishing blood.

### Run 'Em Down Path
Overwhelm people with beta and constant knockdowns to apply pressure while doing decent damage but it's very glasscannon-ish so avoid being predictable and blindside people as much as you can.

</p>

### Relentless Killer Path
Aggressiveness is key for this path and suitable if you prefer Toga's alpha, gamma is more for utility and just making sure you have blood to use which is why maxing it fast is not necessary.

### Blood Cycler Path
For getting gamma to be as dependable as possible fast. Alpha and beta are ideally use for softening up in between transformations while your main dps comes from transformations.

## Techs
### Beta Double Hit
This is dependant on human error so it's not possible to use it intentionally. Sometimes if your enemy is rolling on the same frame you hit them they might ignore the hard knockdown and get hit again.

</p>

### Gamma Damage Double Dip
If you currently have blood stored and you gamma a second person it's possible to transform right after it hits and use the original blood you had because loading blood is not instant.

### Detransform Cancel Invincibility
Double tap crouch anytime you have control of the character while transformed and you swap back to Toga. What makes it notable is it's a cancel and has some i-frames so you can use a beta immediately after an attack from your copy character, remove any debuff states (not applicable to stuns) like trance or to narrowly avoid some damage with the i-frames. Important to note that toga detransforming with her AoE or Traps active from a character she copied (Tech Dabi for example) become only visual with no damage or disappear.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots: HP DMG > Gamma DMG and GP DMG >> Beta DMG >>> Melee DMG**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: GP DMG > Alpha Defense > HP Defense >> Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: Gamma DMG >>> Melee DMG > Alpha Reload > Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots: Gamma DMG >> HP+ and GP+ > Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Slots: Alpha DMG > HP+ >> Else</a><br>
**</a><br>

### Special Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">*Note: Toga is very inconsistent with tunes and functionality since some only work while not transformed (notable examples being revenge skills or willpower). The bias of this list is towards tunes that either she always has access to or that their benefits outweigh the drawback of not being able to activate while transformed.*</a><br>

The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Probably her best special tune. It lets you preserve beta cooldowns, gives you another wake-up option if buildings are nearby and it's useable when transformed so you have an automatic advantage in mirror matches, especially against other grounded characters that would like to use wallrun.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Good wake up option, good for mobility and postioning. Useful for longer air time which is useful with gamma since it works better with elevation.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>The benefits of faster attack and movement speed (which carry over into transformations) is too good to pass up on for her, even if restricted to activating it as base Toga only.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Reliable and supports aggro playstyles.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Good for offsetting needing to fight with how level dependant she is.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Toga is nimble enough to get in and out of places when she wants so snagging unattended boxes is no challenge for her.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>It's nice if you play with it in mind and carries over into transformations.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch034_00.png" width="125"> | **Reinforced Revive** <br>Works when copying someone who has the tune as well but usually convienient since most revive characters run it.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch007_01.png" width="125"> | **Electrification** <br>Useful when used in combination with beta and for protection or roll catching if they try to roll your beta.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>Only works if you activate PU as base Toga. The anti-flinch is very useful but don't sleep on the HP gain either.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>If you're guardbroken while holding alpha or beta you can continue to attack while critical permeation activates, which is nice.|

Embrittlement in the Assault slot greatly improves your damage, but Quirk Factor Release is excellent as well.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-villain.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-villain.png" width="30"> |

Its tech slot is perfect for running Critical Permeation, as Fixer doesn’t get as much use on this costume. Revenge Tech is a decent option as well. The Assault slot will work best with Space Hop to keep you mobile without needing to use your Gamma.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-villain.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-hero.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-hero.png" width="30"> |

Has good damage potential with Strike slots, good reload increases with the Rapid/Tech slots, and good survival with the Assault/Support slots. You can run any option of Fixer, Critical Permeation, HP Sucker or Revenge Technical, but keep in mind their effects won’t be as strong. Embrittlement in the Assault slot gives you extra damage, or Quirk Factor Releaes to help with your reload. <br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-villain.png" width="30"> |

Has tons of Strike Slots for damage, and plenty of Support/Assault for survival. You should run Fixer, Critical Permeation, HP Sucker or Revenge Technical, with GP Sucker or Card Duplication on the right. Due to the TUNING not being a high level you will need to fight quite early if you hope to get use from Card Duplication, so GP Sucker is likely the better option.<br><br><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-green-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><br> <img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-purple-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-red-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-yellow-none.png" width="30"><img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-none.png" width="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img tag="tuningslot" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/slot-blue-villain.png" width="30"> |
