Shoto Todoroki is a strong burst damage that excels at long range damage and close quarters instant damage. He has one of the best range skills of the game and he is great at hitting enemies in situations of opportunity, he lacks vertical mobility and armor, and is frequently seen as worst match-up against armor characters.

## Alpha Skill - Blazing Fields of Roaring Fire

<p align="center">

</p>

Shoto's alpha skill is a rapid-shooting fireball projectile with beamer properties. It has one of the best ranges in the entire game, slightly above 1/5th of the map, allowing you to hit enemies from very far away at ranges that the great majority of beamers wouldn't be able to. This fireball also applies Burning to enemies, dealing damage over time for a few seconds. The size, range and Burning duration from the fireball increase at higher levels.

## Beta Skill - Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's beta skill lets him summon an ice wall where you're aiming. This skill has three main uses: Offense, Defense, and a Hybrid or both. In the offense, this skill can be used to deal huge damage to an enemy in close range. Because Shoto's beta has more lateral range than forward range, a little trick you can do is aim it to your side, so that way you use the lateral range in the front, essentially boosting your forward range. The range of this skill increases dramatically with level, especially at level 9, where it's very hard to avoid.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400b-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400b4-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

Defensively, this ability can act as a wall to protect you from enemy projectiles or seal entrances to heal up or resurrect a teammate. However, this defense can be combined with offense, as Shoto's beta has the special property of allowing his alpha and gamma to go through it, as well as your teammate's projectiles if they are the right kind, allowing you to attack enemies while protected. This can be further enhanced if you manage to trap an enemy in a small corner or space, leaving them unable to get out while you can melt their HP from outside and pretty much guarantee a KO in a lot of cases. Though, keep in mind this doesn't work with another Shoto's beta, you can only attack through your own wall. If you ever need to break your own ice, you can use Air Melees to do so, as your own Air Melees are very effective at destroying your own betas, requiring only one for betas level 1-8 and 2 (or one + a ground melee) for level 9 betas.

## Gamma Skill #1 - Ice Stalagmite
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's base gamma allows him to create a row of ice that freezes opponents that come in contact with it. It has good range, and at max level it becomes quite outstanding. This skill is often followed by alpha spam or beta, as the freezing allows you to squeeze free damage onto the opponent, leading to a high burst of damage. Gamma also has a special property where if you hit the tip at the end of the ice row, it deals much more damage than normal, which in normal conditions is hard to land but can be forced close to walls.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y2-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

## Gamma Skill #2 - Ice Step
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique3_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

A variation of Shoto's gamma. With a forward input, Shoto will ride his own ice, allowing him to move around while leaving a trail of ice. This is his only source of mobility, which you can use to chase enemies or run away if trapping yourself with beta isn't a good option. If you hit an enemy near the end of this ability, you might be able to squeeze a beta for massive damage. Contrary to popular belief, leveling gamma does not increase your travel distance, only the size of the ice trail you leave.<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y3-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y4-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

If no enemies are nearby and you need to loot building roofs such as the ones in Typhoon and Fire Zone in USJ, you can actually take advantage of the little hop at the end of his gamma surf to get on top of other nearby buildings that normally you wouldn't be able to reach.

## Special Action - Scorching Flame Wave
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch004.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's Special Action is a flame curtain thrown forward, which deals little damage but applies very long Burning status to the opponent, up to 16 seconds of Burning directly at the opponent. If you're lucky or you trap an opponent, you might be able to get a KO with this. An important fact to know about this ability is that being damaged by it in DOWN state does not stop their timer, so this can't be used to gain time, only to deal damage.

</p>


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-hit string combo. This ground melee actually has a few interesting properties, the first one is the fact that his first, third and fourth hits apply Burning, albeit so short that doesn't really do damage. The second hit however applies a bit of Freeze Power, which means that if you hit an enemy 4 times with his 2nd melee, you will freeze them. The second property is that his first and second melees have very little downpower, which means that unlike other characters who knockdown enemies in five repetitions of the first melee hit, Shoto can stack up to 10 hits. This can also be done with Melee 1 + Melee 2 cycles, spamming this mini combo 4 times and ending with a Melee 3.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Fast paced aerial melee with low range but good tracking, it has low downpower, also applies burning and can be used to connect alongside combos with almost every skill afterwards, as long it’s used close to the ground. 
It also has style.

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
A fan-favorite for Alpha-centric playstyles. This path gives you extra Alpha charges, allowing for stronger, more consistent Alpha combos. Gameplay focuses on Alphas and Gamma freezes, making Beta less of a combo finisher and more of a tool to create openings for your primary attacks.

</p>

### Safe Around Path
This path is geared toward close-quarters control. While it reduces long-range damage options, it gives you more tools to lock opponents down and capitalize on burst damage setups, especially through freezes.

</p>

### Melee Path
Focused entirely on close-range melee combat, this path maximizes freeze combos around your melee setups rather than relying on Alpha poke or ranged attacks. Ideal for aggressive, in-your-face play.

</p>

### Raw Beta Path
This route eliminates Alpha reliance, focusing purely on Beta damage. Perfect for players who want to dominate close-range encounters with high raw output. One well-placed freeze and Beta combo can clean instantly GP or HP in fights.

</p>

## Techs
### Walk Cancelling
By using a directional input after an ability that locks you in place, you can "free" yourself faster from this locking, allowing you to use stuff like your alpha faster than usual, which can come handy when using alphas after a beta or a gamma, or simply to be generally faster.

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha
Shoto's signature combo, a simple combo that takes advantage of gamma's freeze to squeeze 2 alphas, very flexible as you can do it so long as you hit your gamma, but also your weakest option.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400c1-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
A variation of the previous combo that includes a 3rd alpha. Usually you won't have time to squeeze this 3rd alpha, but if you hit your gamma from far enough, or you're under the effects of a rapid ability card or the Acceleration special tuning, then you might be able to land it. The good news is that failing at performing this combo will simply mean you did the previous one instead, which is way better than wasting an expensive skill for nothing.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma Surf (Tip) -> Beta
The challenge lies in forcing Gamma’s moving input to connect with the last hit, then immediately canceling into Beta. While slightly more consistent than the Alpha-inclusive route, it’s still risky and not reliable in every situation. Requires timing and luck even to push the last hit into a beta, most cases you're gonna be close enough if you're fast to press beta.

</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Beta
A strong and simple close-range combo that can do some big damage.

</p>


### Gamma -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Beta
This is a slightly shorter variation of his easy combo, trimming one melee for smoother execution. While it deals 16 less damage and stun due to the alpha down power nerf, has a easier/faster spacing and a less strict Alpha → Beta link.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Air Melee -> Beta
A variation of the previous combo using Air Melee instead of two ground melees. The timing for beta is tighter than the previous combo, but the extra damage is always welcome.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha
A really strong combo that makes use of all your betas. It's quite consistent if you hit the first beta laterally and the second facing forward, but it can still be done by facing forward with both or laterally with both. Only drawback is that this combo only realistically works on GP, though, since Shoto's beta does a ton of DMG, you will often guardbreak the enemy with it, in which case you can perform the 2nd beta into alpha.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400c6-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/heavy-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha
A stronger variation of the previous combo that deals really high DMG. The 2nd alpha can be difficult to land, but with Walk Cancelling it becomes easier to do (if not actually a must-do). Just like the previous combo, the first beta needs to either guardbreak the enemy, or hit HP for it to work. The 2nd beta will freeze the enemy, which will make hitting your alphas easier.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Gives Shoto his vertical mobility to work around better with his tools, while keeping his presence around buildings and corners.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Weirdly a good option for a beamer character, no one's expecting for a Shoto jumping like a Froppy and shooting alphas on their heads, this can easily makes the difference for his gameplay, thought it centers around alpha plays than anything else.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Monoma's tuning works perfectly around Shoto builds, even more for Strike one, increasing even more his damage or reload potential, and yes this can easily stack all his options, removing all the "scale nerf" on damage.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>Wall Runner is always better for always working consistently, but Rapid Ochaco's tuning can be good for moving up walls and increased speed for your melee combos and beta activations, as well as working like a budget Wall Runner.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch100_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Assault** <br>Strike Shoto relies too much about joining opportunistic fights and getting ready to leave while his beta protects his back, those 20% damage resistance can keep up his tracks when in need.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Good "All Around" Option in case you need faster reloads for all your skills, this will give you more options around your gammas charges mainly, but relies greatly for beta and alpha.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Assault Shiggaraki's tunning still great for fast paced and melee centered characters, and Shoto it's not excluded from this one, this can make your melee combos more deadly as the duration can keep up his resets and alpha playstyle.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch013_00.png" width="125"> | **High-Speed Replenishment** <br>Aizawa's tunning even nerfed can work great for him, as allow Shoto to keep safety behind his walls and rapidly get back up on combat after GP heals.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>Strike Bakugo's still one of the best options for fast damage characters, so Shoto can K.Os opponents and enjoy the plus ultra getting back fast.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch007_01.png" width="125"> | **Electrification** <br>Still a good option for him incase you get too close for melee combos and beta finishers, the problem here is thanks to its scaling ( down power ), it reduces a bit of his mainly options, but gives more time for stuns windows |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_00.png" width="125"> | **Indestructible** <br>Another Armor-Type option that also works for strike shoto, he is a character easy to get in, hard to escape unit due to his easy-to-read get out options, armor avoid those situations, making him less struggle against any wake up staggers.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>Same as Indestructible, but for Plus Ultra, feels great for having more health on activation and armor almost the entire end game time.|

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
It's a beamer character against a beamer character, the difference here is that you have burning damage alongside a freeze and strong combo tool, as long you don't get caught in his blackwhip, you should be good.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
You can easily punish Full Bullet's beta and gamma playstyle with your own gammas, your alpha is weaker than his damage wise, but one reset combo and it's your advantage.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This is a fair match-up even if he has better close ups and speed, he still gonna take a lot of damage if he gets too close with your betas, and in case he tries to run, a few alphas and gammas will shut him down.
<br>

## Katsuki Bakugo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch002/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch002_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
It's a fair fight if you're playing against his beta and gamma skills, his damage can be as great as yours in a easier way, but if you catch him on wake-up, your skills are faster than his.
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Your only play here it's alphas or betas on high levels, he is a fast character with greater damage for his ways and it's hard to catch a good player with your gamma, if you don't match his strength with aim, he will have the high ground, literally.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Rapid Ochaco is a fair match for Shoto, including damage and stun, the difference here is that she stuns on the air, so if you match her strength on the ground, you will have the advantage, if you're on the air, it's a infinite stun on your GP, entirely gone, in this case try to play indoors and don't jump often, it's your better chance against her.
<br>

## Ochaco Uraraka (Zero Satellites) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch003var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
You have good chances against one because how long she stays on endlag situations, straight lines gammas and you break her gameplay, unless she float betas and use her gammas strategically.
<br>

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
You need to play strategically with your gammas and even spam out betas to win this matchup, Shoto is weak against armor and Iida's not an exception, one combo and you're done for.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
This is a fair match, whoever hits more gammas wins this fight, playing behind your beta can leads to good options as well.
<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch004var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
The only strength his opposite version has it's indoors, but you can dominate indoors as well as he can, play around his gammas strategically and this matchup it's yours.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
You have great options against Froppy, your alphas will keep her retreating and if she goes from one close play, one beta will melt her health away, gamma rarely will works as long she stays on the air.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch008/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch008_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Shoto lacks any strength against armor and Kirishima is his strongest opponent as not even Shoto's gamma will work, freeze doesn't work against armor and Kirishima can armor through all his attacks.
<br>

## Eijiro Kirishima (Red Drive) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch008var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
It's a stronger version of the assault one, as long as he keeps using his special action to armor through your skills, this is a bad matchup, you can try freezing his alphas or betas through the shield but the damage output will make the difference here.
<br>

## Denki Kaminari (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch007/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch007_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
You can do everything Kaminari does, but better, better range and combos, as long you keep yourself away from his stun tools, this is a win matchup as you have better range and options than him.

## Denki Kaminari (Lightning) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch007var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
He has a better matchup in longer ranges and keeps stunning you in close range, but he can melt his skills easily, and you can overpower his stun tools afterwards.
<br>

## Momo Yaoyorozu <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch010/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch010_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
A good Momo player will avoid outdoors fights, but as long as you keep her gammas count in check, there is little she can do, your gamma overpowers through her beta shield dash, and your beta can even protect yourself against her gamma.
<br>

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
Monoma is an unpredictable character with any skills he can obtain, many times it's hard to win against a good one, just make sure you hit your alphas and gamma combos.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch046/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch046_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
You can play fair with her if you play smart enough, her gamma can overpower your skills knowing hers are armored, but you can melt her health if you use your gamma strategically behind her beta shield.
<br>

## Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch046var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
She can keep stunning you into alphas and if she gets close it's an armored beta charge, nothing much you can do besides hitting alphas and playing your gammas smartly.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
The only thing Ibara has an advantage against you at is her damage, but everything she does is a stop motion stance, which will give you a good opportunity for alphas, if she gets too close for armored attacks, you can dodge them strategically and try to punish her skills, never risk out melees too close to her, it's easy to get overpowered by her health-melting gamma.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Not hard to play against if you know how to roll his attacks, even the combo ones. A good Mirio will stay out of sight, but one combo is enough to melt his health away.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Mirio can keep attacking while invincible and is really hard to even catch him frozen off his invincible state, if he catches you playing with your beta, he can outsmart you with his beta as well, and one wrong move and his gamma counter won't be easy to catch either.
If not avoided, your only “strength” is playing above buildings, since without wall runner or space hop he can’t really reach you, only with his beta and alpha techniques.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
His grabs can be hard to deal with, but as long you dodge his betas, you can punish his skills easily. If he snipes you with gammas, you have the range and charges, so this match-up is a fair one in most cases.

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Another aerial character that can keep herself far from your gammas, but your alphas will overpower her gameplay as long as she stays in the air, if she loses the aerial advantage, one gamma and she's on a difficult position to take off.
<br>

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
A "good" Shinso will avoid your gammas and punish you easily with alphas, and one combo will always melt your health away, so play carefully with your team and behind your betas, the more gammas you hit, the more you have an advantage on this matchup.

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
As long as you hit your alphas and punish his betas, this shouldn't be a hard matchup, his jump is high so it's hard to freeze one of those, and his gamma can be hard to deal with, if he tries to hit another beta on the air, you have great aim control to hit while he's stuck on the air.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
His alpha makes him take even more alphas and gammas than he normally should, even if you can't freeze him in this state, you have more "DPS" than he does. As long as you dodge his grabs, this is a good matchup.
<br>

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
It's easy to make Aizawa push his aerial alpha directly into your gamma, and catching one in your beta shouldn't be hard either, your gamma can also overpower his.
<br>

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
He's stronger in every aspect, his alpha can outburst and outrange yours easily, and his beta stun kit is better in this case, the play here is to play smartly on his high jumps with predicts.
<br>

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
A good Cementoss player will keep himself out of the ground as long as he can, making your gamma almost useless against one, your better pick here is to play smartly from afar and alpha. If he takes the high ground it's over, you will rarely have time to breathe against one.
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
It's hard to lose against a Strike Endeavor as long as you dodge his beta, his alpha might have a better DPS but his high jumps makes him an easy target, and good gamma predicts will take his health over easily.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Endeavor (Inferno Fist) 
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
A good Assault Endeavor will keep you locked on his beta, making this matchup hard to play, but as long as you keep hitting your alphas you should be good as well.
<br>

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Good dodges and a Good aim will keep him away, gammas will also work great against one, gamma predicts will work the best against this matchup.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
For now it feels this character has a good chance against all of your skills due to his armored beta and fast paced skills, if he catches you in a combo, he has advantage in the air, and for some reason, he can escape combos using his beta.
<br>

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
a good Mt Lady on small form will play greatly around her gamma cancels and beta armored moves, you should have a good chance if you play from afar only, if she's too close, you gotta be lucky and have timing to punish her beta recover, on her giant form, there is nothing much you can do here, only alpha works good against her, and that's reduced damage.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
You have good chances against one, if you keep playing safe behind your betas, his alphas will not reach you, and his best skill against you is his armored gamma, dodge them and this shouldn't be hard.
<br>

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Another fair matchup, his combos can easily melt your health away, unless you catch his predicts off, his stun tools are stronger than yours, play behind betas and maximum gamma caution.
<br>

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
He is another big target to hit and overpower with jump predicts, unless he keep pulling you with gammas or hit you through walls with his beta, this should be an easy matchup.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tech Dabi's Strongest tool against you is his gamma, your gamma can overpower through his betas and even on close corners and indoors you can manage to win against one if you force betas against him.
<br>

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Even if this Dabi can melt your health with one Beta while his gamma is active, your gamma and beta can stagger him away most of the time and waste his skills this way, this should be easy if you predict well against his movements and stop him from grabbing you.
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Unless Tech Toga can hit her gammas perfectly and use her transformations greatly, this is an awesome matchup, your beta can stagger her beta away and give you time to freeze her afterwards, if she plays on the air or buildings, your alpha will make her back off.
<br>

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Not a bad matchup if you know how to dodge her skills, her gamma is easy to punish if you got the timing and predicts, and if she wastes her betas, she needs to touch the ground to start reloading them, this will give you time to put pressure against her reloads.
<br>

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Even with the nerfed Twice using less gammas to stagger you away, you gonna need to destroy his clones first, Twice's strongest gameplay is playing around his clones, so you're gonna need to play smartly behind your betas and destroy his clones as fast as you can, if you can manage that, it shouldn't be a problem.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Even if Compress manages to beta through your alphas, your gamma will catch him off guard, giving you time to get close due to your fast gamma recovery. He has armor on his getaway skill but a beta can easily overpower his health if he doesn't have enough to run.
<br>

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Can't combo a Overhaul that has his combo breaker tool, but if you manage to remove his special action early, you have a good chance against him, just dodge his gammas and you have plenty of time to overpower his skills, even your beta can protect against his skills.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
A Good Kurogiri player will avoid fights, but if he knows how to play against most of the cast, this should be a good fight, you can freeze him most of the time, but his gamma is his best getaway tool, as can armor through your gammas, if you get combo'd by one first, you gonna need to play fast to make the fight even.
