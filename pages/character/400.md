Shoto Todoroki is a strong burst damage that excels at long range damage and close quarters instant damage. He has one of the best range skills of the game and he is great at hitting enemies in situations of opportunity, he lacks vertical mobility and armor, and is frequently seen as worst match-up against armor characters.

## Alpha Skill - Blazing Fields of Roaring Fire

<p align="center">

</p>

Shoto's alpha skill is a rapid-shooting fireball projectile with beamer properties. It has one of the best ranges in the entire game, slightly above 1/5th of the map, allowing you to hit enemies from very far away at ranges that the great majority of beamers wouldn't be able to. This fireball also applies Burning to enemies, dealing damage over time for a few seconds. The size, range and Burning duration from the fireball increase at higher levels.

## Beta Skill - Heaven-Piercing Ice Wall
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's beta skill lets him summon an ice wall where you're aiming. This skill has three main uses: Offense, Defense, and a Hybrid or both. In the offense, this skill can be used to deal huge damage to an enemy in close range. Because Shoto's beta has more lateral range than forward range, a little trick you can do is aim it to your side, so that way you use the lateral range in the front, essentially boosting your forward range. The range of this skill increases dramatically with level, especially at level 9, where it's very hard to avoid.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400b-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400b4-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

Defensively, this ability can act as a wall to protect you from enemy projectiles or seal entrances to heal up or resurrect a teammate. However, this defense can be combined with offense, as Shoto's beta has the special property of allowing his alpha and gamma to go through it, as well as your teammate's projectiles if they are the right kind, allowing you to attack enemies while protected. This can be further enhanced if you manage to trap an enemy in a small corner or space, leaving them unable to get out while you can melt their HP from outside and pretty much guarantee a KO in a lot of cases. Though, keep in mind this doesn't work with another Shoto's beta, you can only attack through your own wall. If you ever need to break your own ice, you can use Air Melees to do so, as your own Air Melees are very effective at destroying your own betas, requiring only one for betas level 1-8 and 2 (or one + a ground melee) for level 9 betas.

## Gamma Skill #1 - Ice Stalagmite
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's base gamma allows him to create a row of ice that freezes opponents that come in contact with it. It has good range, and at max level it becomes quite outstanding. This skill is often followed by alpha spam or beta, as the freezing allows you to squeeze free damage onto the opponent, leading to a high burst of damage. Gamma also has a special property where if you hit the tip at the end of the ice row, it deals much more damage than normal, which in normal conditions is hard to land but can be forced close to walls.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y-gif.gif" width="300" />

</p>

## Gamma Skill #2 - Ice Step
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch004_Unique3_2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

A variation of Shoto's gamma. With a forward input, Shoto will ride his own ice, allowing him to move around while leaving a trail of ice. This is his only source of mobility, which you can use to chase enemies or run away if trapping yourself with beta isn't a good option. If you hit an enemy near the end of this ability, you might be able to squeeze a beta for massive damage. Contrary to popular belief, leveling gamma does not increase your travel distance, only the size of the ice trail you leave.<br>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y3-gif.gif" width="300" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/400y4-gif.gif" width="300" />
</p>

If no enemies are nearby and you need to loot building roofs such as the ones in Typhoon and Fire Zone in USJ, you can actually take advantage of the little hop at the end of his gamma surf to get on top of other nearby buildings that normally you wouldn't be able to reach.

## Special Action - Scorching Flame Wave
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch004.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shoto's Special Action is a flame curtain thrown forward, which deals little damage but applies very long Burning status to the opponent, up to 16 seconds of Burning directly at the opponent. If you're lucky or you trap an opponent, you might be able to get a KO with this. An important fact to know about this ability is that being damaged by it in DOWN state does not stop their timer, so this can't be used to gain time, only to deal damage.

</p>


## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 4-hit string combo. This ground melee actually has a few interesting properties, the first one is the fact that his first, third and fourth hits apply Burning, albeit so short that doesn't really do damage. The second hit however applies a bit of Freeze Power, which means that if you hit an enemy 4 times with his 2nd melee, you will freeze them. The second property is that his first and second melees have very little downpower, which means that unlike other characters who knockdown enemies in five repetitions of the first melee hit, Shoto can stack up to 10 hits. This can also be done with Melee 1 + Melee 2 cycles, spamming this mini combo 4 times and ending with a Melee 3.

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Fast paced aerial melee with low range but good tracking, it has low downpower, also applies burning and can be used to connect alongside combos with almost every skill afterwards, as long it’s used close to the ground. 
It also has style.

## Leveling Paths
### Beamer Path
A fan-favorite for Alpha-centric playstyles. This path gives you extra Alpha charges, allowing for stronger, more consistent Alpha combos. Gameplay focuses on Alphas and Gamma freezes, making Beta less of a combo finisher and more of a tool to create openings for your primary attacks.

### Safe Around Path
This path is geared toward close-quarters control. While it reduces long-range damage options, it gives you more tools to lock opponents down and capitalize on burst damage setups, especially through freezes.

</p>

### Melee Path
Focused entirely on close-range melee combat, this path maximizes freeze combos around your melee setups rather than relying on Alpha poke or ranged attacks. Ideal for aggressive, in-your-face play.

</p>

### Raw Beta Path
This route eliminates Alpha reliance, focusing purely on Beta damage. Perfect for players who want to dominate close-range encounters with high raw output. One well-placed freeze and Beta combo can clean instantly GP or HP in fights.

## Techs
### Walk Cancelling
By using a directional input after an ability that locks you in place, you can "free" yourself faster from this locking, allowing you to use stuff like your alpha faster than usual, which can come handy when using alphas after a beta or a gamma, or simply to be generally faster.

</p>

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Shoto' abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 50 DP<br>
Beta Skill: 200 DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 100 DP (Per Ice Trail), 300 DP (Whole Ice Trail Hit), 450 DP (Tip at the End)<br>
Special Action: 0 DP<br>
Ground Melee: 50 DP (Melee 1 and Melee 2), 150 DP (Melee 3 and Melee 4), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 100 DP<br>
<br>
The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha
Shoto's signature combo, a simple combo that takes advantage of gamma's freeze to squeeze 2 alphas, very flexible as you can do it so long as you hit your gamma, but also your weakest option.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha -> Alpha
A variation of the previous combo that includes a 3rd alpha. Usually you won't have time to squeeze this 3rd alpha, but if you hit your gamma from far enough, or you're under the effects of a rapid ability card or the Acceleration special tuning, then you might be able to land it. The good news is that failing at performing this combo will simply mean you did the previous one instead, which is way better than wasting an expensive skill for nothing.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma Surf (Tip) -> Beta
The challenge lies in forcing Gamma’s moving input to connect with the last hit, then immediately canceling into Beta. While slightly more consistent than the Alpha-inclusive route, it’s still risky and not reliable in every situation. Requires timing and luck even to push the last hit into a beta, most cases you're gonna be close enough if you're fast to press beta.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> Beta
A strong and simple close-range combo that can do some big damage.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>


### Gamma -> Alpha -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Beta
This is a slightly shorter variation of his easy combo, trimming one melee for smoother execution. While it deals 16 less damage and stun due to the alpha down power nerf, has a easier/faster spacing and a less strict Alpha → Beta link.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha
A really strong combo that makes use of all your betas. It's quite consistent if you hit the first beta laterally and the second facing forward, but it can still be done by facing forward with both or laterally with both. Only drawback is that this combo only realistically works on GP, though, since Shoto's beta does a ton of DMG, you will often guardbreak the enemy with it, in which case you can perform the 2nd beta into alpha.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/high-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha
A stronger variation of the previous combo that deals really high DMG. The 2nd alpha can be difficult to land, but with Walk Cancelling it becomes easier to do (if not actually a must-do). Just like the previous combo, the first beta needs to either guardbreak the enemy, or hit HP for it to work. The 2nd beta will freeze the enemy, which will make hitting your alphas easier.
