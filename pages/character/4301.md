Hawks (Slicing Wind) is a highly mobile character that is incredibly efficient at killing the enemy. He mainly focuses on positioning himself in ways to get the jump on the opponent and outright killing them for it. This character is also a super level reliant character, being nearly incapable of performing well without high levels, so if you're super aggressive early game this character may not be for you. Strike Hawks also has an insanely high skill ceiling and is not a character that is easily picked up. Playing Slicing Wind without strong knowledge of every little advantage you can get will probably just get you killed.

<hr style="height: 10px; background-color: white; border: none;">
<h2>Best Map: Any</h2>
Individually, he likely preforms better on UA and Chaos City than he does in USJ due to the increased amount of wallrun spots, however you have to keep in mind that this is true for most characters and Strike Hawks doesn't lose as much as others. For this reason the argument for any map to be his best can be valid, so it's recommended to not worry about your map pick too much.

## Alpha Skill - Cold Wind
<p align="center">

</p>

**The alpha has 3 main modes. Tap, hold, and Super Tornado.**
Tap alpha is a standard projectile that is rather weak at first glance but has some properties that make it really strong. Tap alpha carries your momentum very well, making this skill a great mobility tool. Tap alpha staggers grounded opponents that are on HP and knocks opponents down when they are in the air. This makes this skill a fantastic anti-air ability and great at securing people that are running away thanks to the grounded stagger and disruption it causes. It's also worth noting that when aiming this skill against a target that is in the air aim below them since the hitbox upwards is massive. When using this skill for mobility dont spam it too much and instead delay your shots slightly. Tap alpha has a faster fire rate when you are grounded.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold alpha is an AoE tool primarily used to start combos. This version has some consistency issues when used against targets in the air so it's recommend that you use this skill primarily against grounded targets. It's recommended to aim slightly below their feet so that the tornados hit the ground before hitting the opponent. Most of the time the best use case for this skill is simply area denial in more open areas as it provides visual clutter and long lasting large hitboxes. It's worth noting that this skill only gets the 3 tornados at Level 7. For this reason it's recommended to not use hold alpha basically ever until you have alpha Level 7.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Super Tornado is a special use of hold alpha. When you aim straight up or down with hold alpha you can spawn all 3 tornados very close to each other, sometimes even fully combining into one. Due to the nature of needing all 3 tornados this is again only possible at Level 7 and beyond. This skill's primary use cases are in more enclosed areas as an area denial tool, finishing downed people, and in certain match-ups against characters with downpower reduction such as Rapid All Might and Young All For One. This will essentially place a giant slow moving projectile on the ground that will do 162 damage and cause knockdown, which can make you very hard to approach if used properly.

## Beta Skill - Wind-Cleaving Blade
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch043_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Probably the simplest move in the kit. This is your combo starter, your combo ender, your primary damage, your mobility even. This is your most important ability. 

The first thing to note is that you should almost never charge this skill, as charging the ability has no difference in any of its stats, it does not do more damage nor have more range.
When starting combos with this skill it's important to mention that you should position yourself at the skill's maximum range (you want to hit the enemy at the edge of this skill's range) as this is the only range where beta will consistently combo into other abilities outside of alpha. The skill is also easily rolled after the first 10 damage if you are too close to the opponent.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The use of this ability for mobility is also very limited due to its massive endlag so don't use it when trying to escape an opponent unless you know for sure they don't have the ability to hit you. If you must use this skill for mobility, make sure to at least break line of sight first and make sure the spot you're dashing to also breaks the line of sight.

The direction this skill sends after connected is partially determined by where the opponent is hit. As for forward and backwards it's kinda random but for left to right the skill tries to send the user towards the center of the skill, so if you hit the opponent directly, it will always be sent either straight forward or backwards but if you hit slightly to the left, then the opponent will be sent to the left, with how sharp the angle is depending on how far to the left they were hit. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

This skill gets super armor and a damage spike of 9 damage at Level 7. The primary reason to level this skill is for the super armor. Getting this ability to Level 9 servers little purpose, as you don't get a bigger hitbox or shorter cooldown, just a 12 damage increase relative to level 7.

## Gamma Skill - Spiral Slash
<p align="center">

</p>

**This skill has 2 versions to go over being tap and hold gamma.**
Tap gamma is the primary way to use this skill for mobility since it acts as momentum amplifier which lets you carry high speed momentum and make it even faster such as with his special action. See movement techs for more info. Tap gamma has applications in combos too due to its lower downpower value which lets it do combos that hold gamma cannot do.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold gamma is primarily used for damage. This skill has mobility applications, however that's very niche and generally outclassed by other ways of gaining height and distance, it can rarely come up. This version of gamma however is way better for damage since it has more tracking than tap gamma and is a lingering hitbox that easily catches rolls, and is also your best combo starter when you're in a closer range. It's important to note that when using the skill for damage do not use movement inputs and instead just hold the gamma, if you move too much you risk the opponent falling out of the gamma. See combos for more info.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

At level 7, this skill marks opponents with the final hit, allowing you to see their position through walls for a short amount of time.

</p>

## Special Action #1 - Fierce Wings: Flight
This skill is your primary momentum gain, however it's also your most limited ability. A big part of this characters skill ceiling is making sure you always have this avaliable and never let it go to penalty cooldown, as the massive 19 second penalty reload hurts and often means death. That said proper use of this skill can turn you into one of if not the hardest character to hit with alphas in the entire game so keep that in mind. When using this skill in combination with alpha it's important to note that your momentum will be stopped if you use alpha after the first initial boost the game automatically does. For this reason either do the alpha super early or use gamma.
See mobility techs for more info

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - Fierce Wings: Transport
The pickup version of this skill is niche, but has its uses especially when playing in stacks. It allows you to pickup an ally and transport them to wherever you fly. Allies being carried can attack, and will not dismount so long as it's not an ability that locks them in place like Ibara's alpha. You can also carry allies while they are drinking healing items or while they're lying on the ground after a knockdown (but does not work against DOWNd allies).

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
Melee is a great option for catching wake-ups as its long linger and crazy tracking is strong for catching people that are already weak from a previous combo. There's also combo starter and ender applications for this skill but those are generally harder techs to perform and often redundant. Use this skill when you don't need much damage to finish off the opponent or don't have gamma up. Otherwise use gamma as gamma can combo start and leave a much bigger scratch on the enemy while effectively doing the same thing as ground melee.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This is a quick 2-hit slice that does respectable damage and has some nice combo applications. The tracking on this skill isn't anything special, so using this ability on its own is rather rare, but it's still quite solid as a combo extender in some niche combos.

</p>

## Leveling Paths
It's important to note the reasoning behind each spike in power and why they need levels. <br>
**Alpha:**
- More Damage
- Extra Ammo at Level 4 and 7
- Bigger Hitbox at Level 4 and 9 (The game incorrectly says it's at Level 7 instead of 9)
- Triple Tornado at Level 7

**Beta**
- More Damage (12 DMG spike at Level 7)
- Super Armor at Level 7

**Gamma**
- More Damage
- 2nd Charge at Level 4
- Massive Damage Spike at Level 7
- Cooldown Buff at Level 9
- Marks enemies at Level 7

With this knowledge in mind let's start by saying that Gamma Level 4 is a must, that's the first thing you should do and should generally avoid any fighting until you have that 2nd charge.

Beta Level 9 is also extremely hard to suggest since you don't get any benefit outside of 4 damage for levels 8 and 9 which given how much damage his combos do it isn't that useful, so any levels towards Beta after Beta Level 7 are better spent on other things.

The rest of the levels could be given to teamates. As for beta or gamma 7 first generally it's suggested to get Beta first if possible, but if you're about to enter a fight and can't get Beta Level 7 but can get Gamma Level 7, then get Gamma 7 as it will help you survive in the moment and eventually snowball into Beta Level 7 later.

**Heres a few level paths.**

### Generalist Path
This specializes in being good at all ranges.

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>
This path is extremely good for general play since your melee damage will still be fairly good even at low levels, and getting extra alphas and bigger hitbox sizes helps with combo starting, finishing downed people, area control, and just general damage for situations where a combo is too risky.

### Combo Path
This path specializes in making your combos as impactful as possible as early as possible, but in the process sacrifices some mobility and range potency alpha levels provide.

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>

The rest of the levels could be given to teamates again.

### Recommendation
No_Life456780: "I personally like the Generalist one best since I find even Level 1 Beta and Level 4 Gamma does enough damage in the combos to be impactful, and the alpha damage, ammo, and ability to quick-kill downed people to be more useful."

## Techs 
### Mobility Techs: Perfect Gamma Boost
By spending 40% of your Special Action and a Gamma charge you can get what is likely the fasted momentum in the entire game without tuning or weird glitches. Simply start your flight, input a boost, and immediately as the boost starts use tap gamma. This will shoot you so fast that you will often go into the Poison Mist in later zones bases solely on the speed sending you extra far. Use this to escape fights you don't want to be in anymore but don't spam it as its high special cost can drain it quick.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Special Cancel Boost
By tapping special and inputting a alpha or gamma you will get a sizable speed boost that can be chained over and over if needed to. Use a air melee right before landing for a bit of extra distance. The speed is nowhere comparable to Gamma Boost but this still is super useful especially when combined with the following tech.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Special Conservation
By doing the previous tech with fast enough inputs you can actually get the boost without putting your special on a penalty reload start span (the time it takes to begin reloading again) which makes the above tech nearly infinite when used properly. Proper use of this tech is nearly mandatory to succeed at this character at high Ace level. This tech can be preformed with alpha, gamma, and air melee, all of which having their own uses.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Moon Jump Gamma
This is a tech exclusive to the wall runner passive provided from rapid card effects and the wall runner tuning perk. By inputting a neutral jump off a wall and clicking gamma you get a unbelievable amount of hight. By doing super jumps sideways and using the tech you can also get a sizable speed boost that way. Proper use of this tech is basically mandatory to survive when you dont have access to your special action.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Off-Spawn Special
Your special action wont drain in the first 3 seconds of the game so use that to get far away from your spawn spot if needed.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t5-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Battle Techs: Melee Canceling
By delaying your melee 2 for as long as you can you can cancel it with a movement input which lets you do some combos off melee that are not normally possible. Generally however save this for last as its much less useful to learn than the mobility techs.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t6-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Battle Techs: Super Tornado
By looking straight up or down you can create a giant tornado that is extremely good at finishing downed people and covering area. The best combos for finishing downed people are, tornado tech twice or, tornado tech, hold gamma, alpha tap. Both of these work with 714 levels and are very efficient.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t7-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Escape Tech: I-Frame Flight
By using your special action in invincibility from a knockdown or Critical Permeation you will not lose your i-frames early unlike most actions. Use this to get out of nasty wake-up setups like Shinso Space Hop beta.

## Combos 
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Hawks's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 200 DP (Tap), 85 DP (Per Tick during Hold), 255 DP (Hold Total), 510 DP (Super Tornado)<br>
Beta Skill: 0 DP (Initial Dash Slash), 50 DP (Per Consecutive Slash), 200 DP (All Consecutive Slashes)<br>
Gamma Skill: 20 DP (Per Consecutive Slash), 40 DP (All Tap Consecutive Slashes), 120 DP (All Hold Consecutive Slashes), 200 DP (Final Slash)<br>
Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1, Melee 2), 50 DP (Each Melee 3 Hit), 100 DP (Total Melee 3), 500 DP (Melee 4)<br>
Air Melee: 50 DP (Each Air Melee Cut), 100 DP (Total Air Melee)<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
This works against grounded targets on HP and is completely true. Alpha's fire rate is faster when grounded but the combo is still true even when airborne, it's just a bit harder.

This combo is also important against air targets, where it's only true against when you are grounded and firing as fast as possible while moving forward. If you are also in the air the opponent will have the opportunity to wake, however this often just results in them eating another alpha. The timing is not that hard though, since you can just buffer the alphas.

</p>

### Hold Alpha -> Beta / Tap Gamma / Alpha -> Alpha
You can use beta, gamma, or alpha in this combo but these are just your traditional hold alpha starter combos. Can't be done off the Super Tornado tech however, due to down power restrictions and the last alpha may not work if you get one to many ticks of the hold alpha. Overall strong option.

</p>

### Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha
This combo is primarily used when you land beta in a range that's unfavorable to go for a gamma or melee follow-up. It's a strong and consistent option.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Hold Gamma
This is a traditional Strike Hawks combo that deals high damage. It's consistent but only when using beta from its max range. If you're too close you risk beta sending the enemy in a direction that makes the combo unfavorable.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Tap Gamma -> Alpha
Very similar to the previous combo, just with a bit more damage in exchange for being less pratical due to tap gamma's limited tracking.

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha / Tap Gamma
This combo is the highest damaging one, but is also extremely expensive, putting your beta on a 10 seconds penalty cooldown, which can be very bad to do if you do it too often. It's great against highly durable characters like Technical Tomura Shigaraki, and is also great when your beta hits multiple people as it will combo them all.

</p>

### Beta -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3
You don't get the full melee here and the range where this works is limited. Generally use beta gamma over this.

### Beta -> Melee 1 -> Air Melee -> Alpha
This is one of the most ammo to damage effective combos in Hawks' kit but is also really restrictive in its range so it's not super recommended.

</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> and Hold Gamma -> Alpha
These are very similar combos. Do Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha on HP and Hold Gamma -> Alpha on GP since you can only get the 2nd alpha if the opponent doesn't wake. This is your primary gamma combo starter if you don't have beta to combo after.

</p>

### Hold Gamma (4 Consecutive Slashes) -> Beta -> Alpha
This one is quite weird to do since it doesn't work on GP unless you hit the gamma in a specific way. For this reason it's suggested to use the next combo more. For this combo to work you must only land 4 of the small consecutive slashes, otherwise you won't be able to land the alpha.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Hold Gamma -> Beta
This is just the previous combo with slightly less damage but much better consistency on GP so use this one more when you do a gamma combo starter.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c15-gif.gif" width="400" />

</p>

### Hold Gamma -> Air Melee -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
This combo is done by moving your character around your opponent while carrying them up in a hold gamma this way you can have some momentum during the final hit to carry into the air melee. You need to be above your opponent when going for the air melee or the air melee will simply make you fly underneath the opponent. The alpha is also not true as the opponent can wake, but if they do wake you have strong responses to that, such as a beta or melee string.

</p>

### Special Conservation Alpha -> Alpha -> Air Melee
This combo works by flying in against grounded targets with your alpha staggers. Overall it's a good option if you wish to save a gamma charge and still squeeze out a little bit more damage.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Special Conservation Alpha -> Air Melee -> Hold Gamma
It's very similar to the previous one just with a bit shorter range and more ammo cost in exchange for a good bit more damage.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Hold Gamma (Final Slash) -> Air Melee -> Hold Gamma
This combo is extremely difficult to perform, being likely the hardest combo in his kit. You have to be at a certain range where your gamma would just barely track to the opponent, and you have to hold away from them in order to avoid landing the small slashes. Afterwards, you gotta approach the enemy when you're about to perform the final slash, do air melee, and hold gamma again immediately. You have to land on the ground after the air melee in order to cancel it in time. Overall this combo is niche and super difficult but it's quite flashy.

</p>

When playing this character you want to try to position yourself in a few key ranges, being right at the edge of beta range, very close to the opponent for gamma, or very far for alpha staggers. Which is best for the situation changes heavily, but with your super good movement you should be able to switch between the 3 at will. Just keep in mind your opponents effective range when picking which range to start the fight at. You don't wanna be in gamma starter range against an Assault Eijiro Kirishima for example.

This character is extremely good at positioning himself for teamheals, especially when combined with Divine Protection. Don't be afraid to drop a kill if it means you can position for a teamheal to save your team. 
This character can also very effectively use revive cards as with his superior mobility he's very tough to kill, so if the fight is beyond saving run away and come back later, chances are even if they are still on the body you will be able to get the tag and get away with minimal risk.
Strike Hawks thrives as a support damage hybrid character for the reasons listed above. Learning how to tone it back on the aggression for the sake of your team is very important.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>An amazing tune for Strike Hawks to help alleviate his large level reliance. It's useful in all stages of a match and can even come handy to resurrect teammates or pop teamheals. Due to Strike Hawks' insane mobility, he's able to escape if he gets attacked in the process of opening a Large Item Box (or after).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder** <br>An alternative to Divine Protection that also helps him alleviate his level dependency issue. Hawks' high mobiltiy allows him to get to Kota's position in just a few seconds, no matter how far away he is. Compared to Divine Protection, Kota Finder gives you a higher initial level boost, but it's also a much riskier option, as if an enemy gets him before you do, you will be sitting with a useless tune. For that reason, Kota Finder should be equipped in the 2nd Special Tuning slot to view his location instantly.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>A very strong option to expand on Hawks' mobility and help him with his cooldowns and lower Special Action reliance. This tune enables the Moon Jump gamma tech.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Another mobility option for Strike Hawks, though not as strong as Wall Runner.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>Another strong option to help his cooldowns mid-battle.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch016_00.png" width="125"> | **Special Action Reload Boost** <br>Another cooldown tune to dramatically increase Special Action reload speed after downing an enemy, allowing you to spam your Special Action for 18-20 seconds.|
