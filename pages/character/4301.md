Hawks (Slicing Wind) is a highly mobile character that is incredibly efficient at killing the enemy. He mainly focuses on positioning himself in ways to get the jump on the opponent and outright killing them for it. This character is also a super level reliant character, being nearly incapable of performing well without high levels, so if you're super aggressive early game this character may not be for you. Strike Hawks also has an insanely high skill ceiling and is not a character that is easily picked up. Playing Slicing Wind without strong knowledge of every little advantage you can get will probably just get you killed.

<hr style="height: 10px; background-color: white; border: none;">
<h2>Best Map: Any</h2>
Individually, he likely preforms better on UA and Chaos City than he does in USJ due to the increased amount of wallrun spots, however you have to keep in mind that this is true for most characters and Strike Hawks doesn't lose as much as others. For this reason the argument for any map to be his best can be valid, so it's recommended to not worry about your map pick too much.

## Alpha Skill - Cold Wind
<p align="center">

</p>

**The alpha has 3 main modes. Tap, hold, and Super Tornado.**
Tap alpha is a standard projectile that is rather weak at first glance but has some properties that make it really strong. Tap alpha carries your momentum very well, making this skill a great mobility tool. Tap alpha staggers grounded opponents that are on HP and knocks opponents down when they are in the air. This makes this skill a fantastic anti-air ability and great at securing people that are running away thanks to the grounded stagger and disruption it causes. It's also worth noting that when aiming this skill against a target that is in the air aim below them since the hitbox upwards is massive. When using this skill for mobility dont spam it too much and instead delay your shots slightly. Tap alpha has a faster fire rate when you are grounded.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold alpha is an AoE tool primarily used to start combos. This version has some consistency issues when used against targets in the air so it's recommend that you use this skill primarily against grounded targets. It's recommended to aim slightly below their feet so that the tornados hit the ground before hitting the opponent. Most of the time the best use case for this skill is simply area denial in more open areas as it provides visual clutter and long lasting large hitboxes. It's worth noting that this skill only gets the 3 tornados at Level 7. For this reason it's recommended to not use hold alpha basically ever until you have alpha Level 7.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Super Tornado is a special use of hold alpha. When you aim straight up or down with hold alpha you can spawn all 3 tornados very close to each other, sometimes even fully combining into one. Due to the nature of needing all 3 tornados this is again only possible at Level 7 and beyond. This skill's primary use cases are in more enclosed areas as an area denial tool, finishing downed people, and in certain match-ups against characters with downpower reduction such as Rapid All Might and Young All For One. This will essentially place a giant slow moving projectile on the ground that will do 162 damage and cause knockdown, which can make you very hard to approach if used properly.

## Beta Skill - Wind-Cleaving Blade
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch043_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Probably the simplest move in the kit. This is your combo starter, your combo ender, your primary damage, your mobility even. This is your most important ability. 

The first thing to note is that you should almost never charge this skill, as charging the ability has no difference in any of its stats, it does not do more damage nor have more range.
When starting combos with this skill it's important to mention that you should position yourself at the skill's maximum range (you want to hit the enemy at the edge of this skill's range) as this is the only range where beta will consistently combo into other abilities outside of alpha. The skill is also easily rolled after the first 10 damage if you are too close to the opponent.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The use of this ability for mobility is also very limited due to its massive endlag so don't use it when trying to escape an opponent unless you know for sure they don't have the ability to hit you. If you must use this skill for mobility, make sure to at least break line of sight first and make sure the spot you're dashing to also breaks the line of sight.

The direction this skill sends after connected is partially determined by where the opponent is hit. As for forward and backwards it's kinda random but for left to right the skill tries to send the user towards the center of the skill, so if you hit the opponent directly, it will always be sent either straight forward or backwards but if you hit slightly to the left, then the opponent will be sent to the left, with how sharp the angle is depending on how far to the left they were hit. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

This skill gets super armor and a damage spike of 9 damage at Level 7. The primary reason to level this skill is for the super armor. Getting this ability to Level 9 servers little purpose, as you don't get a bigger hitbox or shorter cooldown, just a 12 damage increase relative to level 7.

</p>

## Gamma Skill - Spiral Slash
<p align="center">

</p>

**This skill has 2 versions to go over being tap and hold gamma.**
Tap gamma is the primary way to use this skill for mobility since it acts as momentum amplifier which lets you carry high speed momentum and make it even faster such as with his special action. See movement techs for more info. Tap gamma has applications in combos too due to its lower downpower value which lets it do combos that hold gamma cannot do.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold gamma is primarily used for damage. This skill has mobility applications, however that's very niche and generally outclassed by other ways of gaining height and distance, it can rarely come up. This version of gamma however is way better for damage since it has more tracking than tap gamma and is a lingering hitbox that easily catches rolls, and is also your best combo starter when you're in a closer range. It's important to note that when using the skill for damage do not use movement inputs and instead just hold the gamma, if you move too much you risk the opponent falling out of the gamma. See combos for more info.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

At level 7, this skill marks opponents with the final hit, allowing you to see their position through walls for a short amount of time.

</p>

## Special Action #1 - Fierce Wings: Flight
This skill is your primary momentum gain, however it's also your most limited ability. A big part of this characters skill ceiling is making sure you always have this avaliable and never let it go to penalty cooldown, as the massive 19 second penalty reload hurts and often means death. That said proper use of this skill can turn you into one of if not the hardest character to hit with alphas in the entire game so keep that in mind. When using this skill in combination with alpha it's important to note that your momentum will be stopped if you use alpha after the first initial boost the game automatically does. For this reason either do the alpha super early or use gamma.
See mobility techs for more info

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special Action #2 - Fierce Wings: Transport
The pickup version of this skill is niche, but has its uses especially when playing in stacks. It allows you to pickup an ally and transport them to wherever you fly. Allies being carried can attack, and will not dismount so long as it's not an ability that locks them in place like Ibara's alpha. You can also carry allies while they are drinking healing items or while they're lying on the ground after a knockdown (but does not work against DOWNd allies).

</p>

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>
Melee is a great option for catching wake-ups as its long linger and crazy tracking is strong for catching people that are already weak from a previous combo. There's also combo starter and ender applications for this skill but those are generally harder techs to perform and often redundant. Use this skill when you don't need much damage to finish off the opponent or don't have gamma up. Otherwise use gamma as gamma can combo start and leave a much bigger scratch on the enemy while effectively doing the same thing as ground melee.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

**Air Melee**<br>
This is a quick 2-hit slice that does respectable damage and has some nice combo applications. The tracking on this skill isn't anything special, so using this ability on its own is rather rare, but it's still quite solid as a combo extender in some niche combos.

</p>

## Leveling Paths
It's important to note the reasoning behind each spike in power and why they need levels. <br>
**Alpha:**
- More Damage
- Extra Ammo at Level 4 and 7
- Bigger Hitbox at Level 4 and 9 (The game incorrectly says it's at Level 7 instead of 9)
- Triple Tornado at Level 7

**Beta**
- More Damage (12 DMG spike at Level 7)
- Super Armor at Level 7

**Gamma**
- More Damage
- 2nd Charge at Level 4
- Massive Damage Spike at Level 7
- Cooldown Buff at Level 9
- Marks enemies at Level 7

With this knowledge in mind let's start by saying that Gamma Level 4 is a must, that's the first thing you should do and should generally avoid any fighting until you have that 2nd charge.

Beta Level 9 is also extremely hard to suggest since you don't get any benefit outside of 4 damage for levels 8 and 9 which given how much damage his combos do it isn't that useful, so any levels towards Beta after Beta Level 7 are better spent on other things.

The rest of the levels could be given to teamates. As for beta or gamma 7 first generally it's suggested to get Beta first if possible, but if you're about to enter a fight and can't get Beta Level 7 but can get Gamma Level 7, then get Gamma 7 as it will help you survive in the moment and eventually snowball into Beta Level 7 later.

**Heres a few level paths.**

### Generalist Path
This specializes in being good at all ranges.

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Arrow.png" width="45" />
     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>
This path is extremely good for general play since your melee damage will still be fairly good even at low levels, and getting extra alphas and bigger hitbox sizes helps with combo starting, finishing downed people, area control, and just general damage for situations where a combo is too risky.

### Combo Path
This path specializes in making your combos as impactful as possible as early as possible, but in the process sacrifices some mobility and range potency alpha levels provide.

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>

The rest of the levels could be given to teamates again.

### Recommendation
No_Life456780: "I personally like the Generalist one best since I find even Level 1 Beta and Level 4 Gamma does enough damage in the combos to be impactful, and the alpha damage, ammo, and ability to quick-kill downed people to be more useful."

## Techs 
### Mobility Techs: Perfect Gamma Boost
By spending 40% of your Special Action and a Gamma charge you can get what is likely the fasted momentum in the entire game without tuning or weird glitches. Simply start your flight, input a boost, and immediately as the boost starts use tap gamma. This will shoot you so fast that you will often go into the Poison Mist in later zones bases solely on the speed sending you extra far. Use this to escape fights you don't want to be in anymore but don't spam it as its high special cost can drain it quick.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Special Cancel Boost
By tapping special and inputting a alpha or gamma you will get a sizable speed boost that can be chained over and over if needed to. Use a air melee right before landing for a bit of extra distance. The speed is nowhere comparable to Gamma Boost but this still is super useful especially when combined with the following tech.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Special Conservation
By doing the previous tech with fast enough inputs you can actually get the boost without putting your special on a penalty reload start span (the time it takes to begin reloading again) which makes the above tech nearly infinite when used properly. Proper use of this tech is nearly mandatory to succeed at this character at high Ace level. This tech can be preformed with alpha, gamma, and air melee, all of which having their own uses.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Moon Jump Gamma
This is a tech exclusive to the wall runner passive provided from rapid card effects and the wall runner tuning perk. By inputting a neutral jump off a wall and clicking gamma you get a unbelievable amount of hight. By doing super jumps sideways and using the tech you can also get a sizable speed boost that way. Proper use of this tech is basically mandatory to survive when you dont have access to your special action.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Mobility Techs: Off-Spawn Special
Your special action wont drain in the first 3 seconds of the game so use that to get far away from your spawn spot if needed.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t5-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Battle Techs: Melee Canceling
By delaying your melee 2 for as long as you can you can cancel it with a movement input which lets you do some combos off melee that are not normally possible. Generally however save this for last as its much less useful to learn than the mobility techs.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t6-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Battle Techs: Super Tornado
By looking straight up or down you can create a giant tornado that is extremely good at finishing downed people and covering area. The best combos for finishing downed people are, tornado tech twice or, tornado tech, hold gamma, alpha tap. Both of these work with 714 levels and are very efficient.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t7-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Escape Tech: I-Frame Flight
By using your special action in invincibility from a knockdown or Critical Permeation you will not lose your i-frames early unlike most actions. Use this to get out of nasty wake-up setups like Shinso Space Hop beta.

## Combos 
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Hawks's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 200 DP (Tap), 85 DP (Per Tick during Hold), 255 DP (Hold Total), 510 DP (Super Tornado)<br>
Beta Skill: 0 DP (Initial Dash Slash), 50 DP (Per Consecutive Slash), 200 DP (All Consecutive Slashes)<br>
Gamma Skill: 20 DP (Per Consecutive Slash), 40 DP (All Tap Consecutive Slashes), 120 DP (All Hold Consecutive Slashes), 200 DP (Final Slash)<br>
Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1, Melee 2), 50 DP (Each Melee 3 Hit), 100 DP (Total Melee 3), 500 DP (Melee 4)<br>
Air Melee: 50 DP (Each Air Melee Cut), 100 DP (Total Air Melee)<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
This works against grounded targets on HP and is completely true. Alpha's fire rate is faster when grounded but the combo is still true even when airborne, it's just a bit harder.

This combo is also important against air targets, where it's only true against when you are grounded and firing as fast as possible while moving forward. If you are also in the air the opponent will have the opportunity to wake, however this often just results in them eating another alpha. The timing is not that hard though, since you can just buffer the alphas.

</p>

### Hold Alpha -> Beta / Tap Gamma / Alpha -> Alpha
You can use beta, gamma, or alpha in this combo but these are just your traditional hold alpha starter combos. Can't be done off the Super Tornado tech however, due to down power restrictions and the last alpha may not work if you get one to many ticks of the hold alpha. Overall strong option.

</p>

### Beta -> Alpha -> Alpha
This combo is primarily used when you land beta in a range that's unfavorable to go for a gamma or melee follow-up. It's a strong and consistent option.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Hold Gamma
This is a traditional Strike Hawks combo that deals high damage. It's consistent but only when using beta from its max range. If you're too close you risk beta sending the enemy in a direction that makes the combo unfavorable.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta -> Tap Gamma -> Alpha
Very similar to the previous combo, just with a bit more damage in exchange for being less pratical due to tap gamma's limited tracking.

### Beta -> Beta -> Alpha / Tap Gamma
This combo is the highest damaging one, but is also extremely expensive, putting your beta on a 10 seconds penalty cooldown, which can be very bad to do if you do it too often. It's great against highly durable characters like Technical Tomura Shigaraki, and is also great when your beta hits multiple people as it will combo them all.

</p>

### Beta -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 -> Melee 3
You don't get the full melee here and the range where this works is limited. Generally use beta gamma over this.

### Beta -> Melee 1 -> Air Melee -> Alpha
This is one of the most ammo to damage effective combos in Hawks' kit but is also really restrictive in its range so it's not super recommended.

</p>

### Gamma -> Alpha -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> and Hold Gamma -> Alpha
These are very similar combos. Do Gamma -> Alpha -> Alpha on HP and Hold Gamma -> Alpha on GP since you can only get the 2nd alpha if the opponent doesn't wake. This is your primary gamma combo starter if you don't have beta to combo after.

</p>

### Hold Gamma (4 Consecutive Slashes) -> Beta -> Alpha
This one is quite weird to do since it doesn't work on GP unless you hit the gamma in a specific way. For this reason it's suggested to use the next combo more. For this combo to work you must only land 4 of the small consecutive slashes, otherwise you won't be able to land the alpha.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/medium+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Hold Gamma -> Beta
This is just the previous combo with slightly less damage but much better consistency on GP so use this one more when you do a gamma combo starter.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c15-gif.gif" width="400" />

</p>

### Hold Gamma -> Air Melee -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
This combo is done by moving your character around your opponent while carrying them up in a hold gamma this way you can have some momentum during the final hit to carry into the air melee. You need to be above your opponent when going for the air melee or the air melee will simply make you fly underneath the opponent. The alpha is also not true as the opponent can wake, but if they do wake you have strong responses to that, such as a beta or melee string.

</p>

### Special Conservation Alpha -> Alpha -> Air Melee
This combo works by flying in against grounded targets with your alpha staggers. Overall it's a good option if you wish to save a gamma charge and still squeeze out a little bit more damage.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Special Conservation Alpha -> Air Melee -> Hold Gamma
It's very similar to the previous one just with a bit shorter range and more ammo cost in exchange for a good bit more damage.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Hold Gamma (Final Slash) -> Air Melee -> Hold Gamma
This combo is extremely difficult to perform, being likely the hardest combo in his kit. You have to be at a certain range where your gamma would just barely track to the opponent, and you have to hold away from them in order to avoid landing the small slashes. Afterwards, you gotta approach the enemy when you're about to perform the final slash, do air melee, and hold gamma again immediately. You have to land on the ground after the air melee in order to cancel it in time. Overall this combo is niche and super difficult but it's quite flashy.

</p>

When playing this character you want to try to position yourself in a few key ranges, being right at the edge of beta range, very close to the opponent for gamma, or very far for alpha staggers. Which is best for the situation changes heavily, but with your super good movement you should be able to switch between the 3 at will. Just keep in mind your opponents effective range when picking which range to start the fight at. You don't wanna be in gamma starter range against an Assault Eijiro Kirishima for example.

This character is extremely good at positioning himself for teamheals, especially when combined with Divine Protection. Don't be afraid to drop a kill if it means you can position for a teamheal to save your team. 
This character can also very effectively use revive cards as with his superior mobility he's very tough to kill, so if the fight is beyond saving run away and come back later, chances are even if they are still on the body you will be able to get the tag and get away with minimal risk.
Strike Hawks thrives as a support damage hybrid character for the reasons listed above. Learning how to tone it back on the aggression for the sake of your team is very important.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>An amazing tune for Strike Hawks to help alleviate his large level reliance. It's useful in all stages of a match and can even come handy to resurrect teammates or pop teamheals. Due to Strike Hawks' insane mobility, he's able to escape if he gets attacked in the process of opening a Large Item Box (or after).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder** <br>An alternative to Divine Protection that also helps him alleviate his level dependency issue. Hawks' high mobiltiy allows him to get to Kota's position in just a few seconds, no matter how far away he is. Compared to Divine Protection, Kota Finder gives you a higher initial level boost, but it's also a much riskier option, as if an enemy gets him before you do, you will be sitting with a useless tune. For that reason, Kota Finder should be equipped in the 2nd Special Tuning slot to view his location instantly.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>A very strong option to expand on Hawks' mobility and help him with his cooldowns and lower Special Action reliance. This tune enables the Moon Jump gamma tech.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Another mobility option for Strike Hawks, though not as strong as Wall Runner.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>Another strong option to help his cooldowns mid-battle.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch016_00.png" width="125"> | **Special Action Reload Boost** <br>Another cooldown tune to dramatically increase Special Action reload speed after downing an enemy, allowing you to spam your Special Action for 18-20 seconds.|

An alternative way of describing the match-ups will be used since the burst damage
factor of Strike Hawks is very important to his match-ups, so when looking at the rating consider the
below definitions (could be updated with better wording in the future).

<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Very Unfavorable**</a> - Practically the only way to win is to get a high dmg combo off before the
opponent sees you, as the opponent counters your kit extremely well and is hard to get the
combo in a face to face encounter.

<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Unfavorable**</a> - Your options against this character are limited and generally come
down to performing the high dmg combos, however the opponent has less ways to prevent this from happening.

<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Even**</a> - Not as reliant on getting the high dmg combos to win/super reliant on these combos, but performing them
is super easy

<a style="color: lime !important;">**Favorable**</a> - You don't need the high dmg combos to win this match-up as your kit as a whole
performs well against the opponent / getting the combo is super consistent and easy.

<a style="color: lime !important;">**Very Favorable**</a> - The opponent essentially has 0 ways to prevent you from doing what you
want. That can be a high dmg combo or simply using your kit in a more traditional way.

Each character will also be given 2 separate ratings.<br>
Low Level - Generally this refers to Strike Hawks not having his high level capabilities
yet, but for some matchups this will also consider the opponent being low level directly.

High Level - This generally refers to when both users are full Level 9 or close to it, meaning
Strike Hawks has all his Level 7 effects and the opponent is also likely maxed out.

This distinction is important to make due to how many match-ups get affected by levels.

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score (Low Levels): 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Difficulty Score (High Levels): 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Levels don't impact this match-up too much. Generally the main difference is the general
damage increase both users get. Regardless try not to use beta against this character
unless you are certain it will connect as if it fails to hit you will eat a large
blackwhip combo. Keep your superior mobility in mind and don't be afraid to run away and
take a reset if needed.
<br>

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score (Low Levels): 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Difficulty Score (High Levels): 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
At low levels Strike Deku lacks the massive alpha damage he needs to be a threat in this
match-up, and your own lack of armor and less damage doesn't change the match-up too much.
Try not to trade recklessly with Strike Deku's beta, as without Beta Level 7 you will be
knocked back, but you can easily wait for the endlag and punish then.

You have strong responses to every move in his kit generally. Trade with deku's melee using beta
armor, whiff punish beta with your own beta, and roll any lock-on attempts. There is one
key move that you have 0 response to however, and that is grounded alpha. Due to grounded
alphas large hitbox and projectile speed this skill can easily catch your flight and due
to its hard knockdown properties and armor you have no way to stagger him out of it, you also
have no way to trade with it either. Just try to catch him in a combo
before he realizes what's going on and then trade alphas with him from there.

The main difference of why low levels is more favorable here is due to Strike Bakugo not
having the ability to burst you down as fast yet, and he has much less alpha ammo. Combined
with his thin alpha hitbox you will be able to easily avoid this characters shots at all
levels and combo him for large amounts of damage with ease. As with Assault Deku, keep in
mind that if you need a reset take it, as the opponent doesn't really have any way to
prevent it.

Hitting Rapid Bakugo with low level alphas can be quite difficult, but when you get higher
levels landing those hits becomes significantly easier since your alpha hitbox increases
dramatically with levels. You also gain the ability to kill him almost instantly with a
combo once you are full Level 9, which is also great for bursting him when you catch him lacking.
Keep in mind that Rapid Bakugo is one of the few characters capable of keeping up with your
movement for extended periods of time so getting a reset won't be as easy in this match-up.

Beta armor lets you trade with her car throw, which lets you burst her down with little
issue. You also have a fantastic anti air with your alpha against her, as well as enough
mobility to chase her for a long amount of time, which is something she likely won't expect.
Try and stay off the ground for extended periods of time however, as she can still burst you down quickly
if she lands a gamma, but if she tries to do so you can take the opportunity and combo her
with beta so it's a double-edged sword.

Assault Ochaco has no way to punish you when you are airborne, and your alpha is fantastic
at punishing her attempts to use alpha. At higher levels you gain the ability to use beta
against her alpha safely, and in doing so get a large combo which will end the battle
almost instantly. Just be weary of gamma, particularly the platform as you cannot use beta into
her gamma or you will eat a lot of damage and will likely need to reset the fight. For this
reason it's recommended not fighting her indoors too much.

When trying to approach Todoroki at low levels it's extremely hard to get good hits due to
your lack of beta armor, but once you get it at Level 7, you gain the ability to trade
positively against Shoto. Just stay off the ground, avoid combos not starting with beta
level 7, and do not chase him indoors. You can win this match-up but it takes careful play and
good timing to win, however you have the luxury of mobility here so you can oftentimes get
away and reset if needed.

You have the ability to combo Froppy for significant amounts of damage and can challenge
her main damage sources extremely well by using your alpha against her own, as well as using
your beta when she tries to come in for her own beta. That being said Froppy isn't a character
that will take fights in a 1v1 but rather try and catch you while you're weak, so if Froppy
tries this against you, use your superior mobility to escape or your high damage output to
combo her enough so that she loses the desire to chase. If she tries running from you
chase her the best you can as she is a priority target to take down in matches due to
Reinforced Revive and her teamheal capabilities.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Despite his terrible mobility, Kirishima actually doesn’t fare too badly against Compress in other departments. For starters none of his attacks can be reflected or blocked by Compress’ Beta, making the move useless in this fight. Additionally Kirishima is one of the kings of wake up catches, with his two most powerful moves knocking you down on hit and being great at catching you too. Compress hates being put in these kinds of situations as he has very limited options on what can be done on wake up. The worst part of this match up for Compress however is actually Kirishima's Special Action. Hardening completely removes the stun from Compress’ Alpha, one of his best tools, and also cuts the damage by a large amount. The only reason Compress doesn't lose this match up is purely because of Kirishima’s terrible movement. In areas with buildings/high ground, Compress' best option is to try and stay above Kiri and use his Alpha to scare him away, or force him to eat damage on his approach, before running and repeating over and over. If Kirishima had movement, he’d be an absolute nightmare for Compress.

Compress’ greatest nightmare, Red Drive takes all the good things about Assault Kirishima and gives it movement. This is likely Compress’ worst match up. Everything said about Kirishima’s Special Action before is true once more, except now he is also much harder to hit. Red Drive’s Special Action basically makes him unpunishable in the Compress match up. Alongside that, his combo game and damage potential are insane, easily out performing Compress. It’s even harder to benefit from catching Red Drive off guard due to his much larger health pool, and Special Action meaning you may not even be stunning him when you do get the drop. The only redeeming factor of this match up is that Compress can reflect Red Drive’s Gamma, which is actually a very big deal here. Red Drive players love to spam this when you’re out of range or in the air, so this gives you an opportunity to deal high damage back from relative safety since you can easily be hit if you try to spam your Alpha while up high. It's best to try to stay above him using your Alpha in moderation and reflecting his Gamma when he tries to hit you back. While his movement is excellent, Compress can make ground initially when it comes to getting away. Even if he can catch up fairly well, it at least gives Compress a chance to run.

Compress can easily reflect Kaminari’s Alpha shots, and keep up with him due to his lesser mobility. His Beta will leave him stationary, so use this to your advantage if he ever misses it to deal huge damage to him. If you're ever caught inside, try and back up while spamming Alphas at him now that he can't move. The thing that evens out this match-up is just how high the damage is when Kaminari lands his Gamma on you. While telegraphed, it still comes out decently fast, and if you're hit you’ll take huge damage, or maybe even go down if the Kaminari is with a coordinated team. His Special Action also makes landing melee combos on him impossible without being countered, severely limiting your methods of damage outside of using your Alpha, or reflecting his.

Compress’ Beta will block Lightning’s mines, as well as reflect his Alpha while he isn’t ADS. This highly limits Lighting's options in close range engagements, meaning his best bet is likely to try and Gamma you for a stun. Reflecting his Alpha can actually stun him in return if he tries spamming it without thinking, setting you up for some free hits. You’ll also need to be weary of his Special Action preventing your melee combos too. When it comes to Lightning’s homing (aim mode) Alpha, you unfortunately block it rather than reflect, but this is good enough to keep you safe while you’re in his range. Your Gamma is great for closing ground so you can confront these players as well. If you ever have to escape from a Lightning Denki using your Gamma, remember to activate Beta in the air the second you exit your marble to prevent them from hitting you with their homing Alpha as you run.

A good match up for Compress, he out performs Momo in most situations. Her lack of movement and consistent ranged damage is very noticeable here, as she essentially can't do anything to you in even a midrange engagement, and even less if you're above her. Her Beta, while it does block your shots, is very simple to dodge, and can also be teleported over to rain Alphas from above. If she uses it to run you can hit her from behind or Gamma to catch up. While her Gamma is strong, it isn’t great outside and the cannonballs can also be reflected by your Beta if needed. Your Beta also blocks its splash damage. Her Alpha is likely her best option here, as it easily knocks down and allows for wake up catching with her Gamma. It can be reflected however, so predict when she uses it and you’ll stun her to start your own combo. The only place she can turn tides is inside where her close range expertise can excel, especially her cannons. For the most part, just don’t follow her inside because that's where she wants to be.

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
While this match up is often decided by what quirks Monoma is currently in possession of, he does have something else he can take advantage of. Obviously his Special Action refreshing is what beings referred to here, giving him some incredible movement with his Beta and stolen quirks. In early to midgame, Monoma is near impossible to catch up thanks to this refresh unless he gets very cocky and doesn’t get far enough away. If his Special Action depletes or he doesn't go far enough, Compress’ double Gamma is good movement against him. If he’s able to copy your Gamma it makes his mobility even scarier. His refresh also allows Monoma to spam a variety of other moves, many of which Compress could possibly struggle with. In terms of his base kit his Alpha can be reflected for surprisingly high damage thanks to its high fire rate, or leaves him pretty exposed to a stun from your own Alpha. His beta is the biggest issue just because it's a fast melee attack, but it fortunately isn't too threatening. If he enters his Gamma its best not to hit him so he doesn't get given yours. If he starts healing with it active, you’ll need to weigh your options to determine if it's worth stopping him at the price of giving your Gamma. Typically it won't be unless your sure you can secure the kill immediately afterward. When it comes to Monoma's who air stall, Compress does actually do quite well against them. Your double Gamma allows you to get incredibly high in the air, and even if he’s still above you your Alphas range can still allow you to hit him. Grab a teammate with your Special Action and bring them up there too to try and force him down even faster.

Kendo’s shield is a huge problem for Compress in a fight. Its huge size and high health means in a one on one situation, there's really no way to hit Kendo until you can wear down her shields health. To make matters worse, if the item from Compress’ Alpha isn't released before hitting the shield, it will only take the 5 damage the marble hits for instead of the much larger damage done by the item and shockwave. Kendo is another character who loves wake up catching too, and her Gamma is excellent for this. Her Alpha also does big damage while in close range, and while you can reflect it for big damage back she may bait you into this before hitting you with Gamma. Her melee combo game is also very good, and much better than Compress’, so be careful there too. Try to just keep her at a distance to whittle down her shield and run with your Gamma if she gets close. Fortunately she doesn't have the movement to chase or run from Compress, so without her shield she’s a sitting duck.

Unfortunately Kendo has been given movement to chase and run from Compress, turning an already bad match up into a terrible one. While Compress’ double Gamma is still better overall for distance, Twin Palm’s Gamma into air melee movement is incredible and she can definitely still catch up if you aren’t careful, especially early game or in smaller final circles. Her Alpha will stun you too (even through Gammas armor) and although you can reflect it to stun her and use Gamma to get away or start your own combo, you're bound to take high damage if you’re hit. Her Beta allows her to soak up damage while increasing its power, and like Kirishima prevents your Alpha from stunning her, nullifying Compress’ greatest strength. All of her moves can easily force wake up catches too. If she tries to catch you with a charged Alpha or while you're in the air, hold Beta and force her to miss her Alpha or take the reflected hit so you can Gamma. If she keeps holding it, move to cover or break line of sight to try getting away with Gamma. If she doesn't charge the Alpha she could pretty much try anything, so it's best to just try and dodge what she chooses. Trying to reflect an uncharged Alpha is not worth taking a Beta or Gamma if you predict wrong.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara can be a very scary fight when on Compress. With her Alpha she has huge range and even bigger damage, putting Compress at the disadvantage as he can’t block it with his Beta and it knocks him down. Her Beta, especially at higher levels, is great at both knocking you down and catching your wake up if you aren't careful. Her Gamma does insane damage directly to your HP, and like all grabs can hit you through your Gamma’s armor and stop it going off. Her close range expertise means you rarely want to try and melee her, especially since she has armor on all of her moves. All of her moves do leave her as a stationary target on a whiff, so make sure to capitalize on that to return big damage or get distance from her if you're in her Beta/Gamma range. The sky and tall buildings are unsurprisingly your best bet in this fight, as she's limited to using only her Alpha and being an easy target to hit if she misses while you look down on her. If you're in the air and she hits you however, you become a lot easier to hit again as your recovery takes away a lot of your momentum, making you a slow moving target in the open air. Make sure to utilize your i-frames so you aren't an easy target for a second hit.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While Mirio is prone to exploding if you can catch him off guard, his movement and love for close up encounters can sometimes put Compress at the disadvantage. He loves close quarters fights, and his movement is also superb, being one of very few characters who can outright get away from Compress. His Gamma being able to block your projectiles and force you in close can be good to bait you into an uncomfortable position. What helps Compress the most in this match up is Mirio’s low health pool, and easily exploitable punish windows upon an Alpha or Beta whiff. These leave Mirio stationary and if you're fast enough to hit him can lead to him taking big damage. If you aren't quick enough however, he can reset the situation if he enters his Special Action for invincibility to wait out his cooldowns. In his Special Action he can also just run up to you directly without threat to force close range fights. In this situation it's best to either run yourself, or use Gamma to get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Fitting his namesake, Sheer Counter is an excellent counter to just about everything Compress wants to do. For starters his Alpha makes him invincible, meaning not only can you not hit him with your own Alphas, but reflected Alphas don’t hit him back either unless he stands still. This is terrible for Compress, as your main method of damage is completely stopped here, and you can’t stun him either. His counter is also a fantastic move against Compress. Since your offensive gameplan pretty much boils down to spam Alpha, it's very easy for Sheer Counter to predict this and time his Gamma accordingly. Your Alphas huge size and the shockwave after make it especially easy for him to counter you. While his movement isn’t superb compared to Compress’, he actually has a way to counter your Gamma too. By timing his Gamma alongside yours, hitting him with the smoke bomb you drop will send him straight after you to easily knock you back down. You must play cautiously around Sheer Counter, baiting his counter so you can punish him on a whiff or run away. His Beta can be similarly punished if he misses, and fortunately isn’t too strong of a move. His Special Action is still a problem letting him engage you for free, except you now have to be careful about timing his counter if you try and Gamma away from him while he’s in it.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Although his Alpha is blocked by your Beta, the grab version of it can still be quite scary as a hit means you’re likely to be losing a large chunk of your health. That being said, a whiff or hit into your Beta often lets you squeeze an Alpha hit back at him while he recovers, giving you the sustainability to win the fight. His Beta is a bit trickier, as its tracking and movement speed can sometimes make it a bit awkward to dodge. On hit it also gives him invisibility, so make sure you keep track of him if he knocks you down. Learning the dodge window for this move makes it much more bearable since it's his best option against Compress. His Gamma is fortunately not a huge problem for Compress. While it will always be annoying as a third party tool, in a direct fight Compress can just block it with his Beta. If you catch a Tamaki using it with their back turned or if they miss, they’re a sitting duck and you can often deal huge damage or even downright knock them if they don’t cancel it fast enough.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
One of Compress’ better match ups, Nejire is one of only four characters whose entire moveset can be stopped by Compress’ Beta. Her Alpha is quite damaging, but if she isn't careful you can reflect it back for huge damage, meaning she has to be careful when using it. Her Beta can be blocked with yours, and while it is good for knocking you down it takes quite a while to do so meaning you can easily put your Beta up to stop it. You can allow her to waste her Beta charge firing into your own Beta and then Alpha her back if she shifts focus. If she isn't looking at you her Beta leaves her a mostly stationary target to wail on too. Her Gamma can give her height making her harder to hit, but once more can be reflected, although it rarely actually hits her back. It is her best wake up catch in this match up, and it can still be threatening if she has her team with her to stop your Beta going up. Her movement is generally worse than Compress’ and while her floating and air dash can make it more difficult to hit her, you can just wait for her to come down since she can’t do anything to you up there anyway thanks to your Beta.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While his Alpha can be blocked, often allowing you to slip in an Alpha while he recovers, his sheer damage potential and team combo potential still make this match up quite hard. Shinso is another character who thrives in catching your wake up with his Gamma and Beta. Teleporting into the air while he falls with his Beta is a great way to both take loads of damage and get knocked out of your marble, wasting a charge. This combined with the fact that the brief animation before you teleport leaves you wide open to being hit by his Gamma, Alpha, or even his Special Action, means your best wake up option is incredibly risky if you can't find a safe spot to use it. His Gamma allows him to land all his moves much easier if it connects, and it can even be mixed into combos for a guaranteed hit to make running even harder. On a miss however, he does leave himself quite open while he recovers which will allow you to spam Alphas in return. This also applies to his Special Action, and his Alpha as mentioned before. His movement is good but doesn't bring him quite as far as Compress' Gammas, and he's using up his best offensive skill to get around, so if you need to get away or you have to chase him neither option should be too difficult provided you can get going.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While All Might’s Alpha can be reflected like most others, you may be surprised to learn you can even block the splash damage from it with your Beta as well. All Might's Beta will be his best tool against you on Compress, as if you don’t recover quick enough after being hit, it can be combo’d into a second Beta or into a ton of Alphas. For this reason if you're hit by it, recover as fast as possible, but let your i-frames run out so you can’t be hit by any subsequent moves, especially that second Beta. If you start reflecting Alphas, this is most likely the move he’ll use in response, so get ready to dodge it. All Might's Gamma isn't too strong, and is mostly used as a way to stall since you can’t hit him while he’s in it. Typically All Might players will use his Special Action leap after exiting this to run, so be ready to quickly wail on him with Alphas while he crouches and then keep chase with your Gamma. This should fortunately be quite easy, as although All Might has decent movement Compress’ is still superior. If he chooses to use his Betas to get more distance it also means his best move in this fight will be gone, so keep track of how many charges he uses when moving around.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatlings Alpha is just about one of the easiest Beta reflection targets in the entire game. Its long start up before it starts dealing big damage will give you ample time to begin reflecting it with your Beta. Just be mindful you can't stun him out of his Alpha due to its armor, so if you try to trade Alphas you’ll be on the backfoot. If he tries to use his uncharged Beta, you can also reflect that to stun him and start potential Combos. Holding your Beta out will likely bait him into going for one of his two most dangerous moves in this match up, his charged Beta, or his Gamma. His Gamma is especially damaging, and can grab you out of your own Gamma, so be on the lookout for those two moves. If he misses his Gamma his recovery is quite punishable, allowing you to spam your Alpha against him. Although Gatlings movement is a lot better than default All Might’s, escape or chase still shouldn’t be a primary concern for Compress here.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While this may seem like a good matchup on paper thanks to Compress’ Beta being able to stop all of his skills, this unfortunately isn't enough to trivialize this fight like it does for other characters the Beta fully counters. Armored All Might is able to excel in all ranges thanks to his versatile kit, and while your Beta does stop his long range Alpha shots, his close quarters prowess is what makes this matchup truly difficult. Armored All Might can easily close distance on you using either his Special Action or Beta, where his excellent Melee and Air Melee attacks can easily take advantage of you holding your Beta up. If you drop your Beta to try and counter this however, he can easily start high damage combos using the stun from his Beta or Gamma, or even just by spamming Alpha to freeze you. You really have to try and stun him while he’s stuck in something like his aerial Beta, ground Beta recovery, or Special Action to prevent him from just straight up out damaging you. Even this may not work however, as he can still send his summoned drones after you while stunned, allowing him to stop your Alphas and break out of your combo. If you need to run from Armored All Might you’ll also need to be careful as his Beta can easily grab you out of it, and his tracking drones can stun you in the air. Even if you do teleport away, his superb movement can easily allow him to catch up to you if he knows where you're going. This also means it can be quite difficult to chase him down.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
While Aizawa’s Alpha can be blocked by your Beta, often allowing you to squeeze an Alpha in between his attempts to grab you, his damage potential and reliable counter to your whole kit easily gives Aizawa the upper hand. When you throw your Alpha in between his attempts to grab you really have to try and aim for a stun or else he can spam his own Alpha to try and start his high damage combos. Aizawa can also easily close distance and dart around you using his aerial Alpha and Beta, making him very hard to hit. Aizawas Gamma is a hard move to fight when on Compress, as its ability to block all shots from his front and sides means you’ll have to be behind him to get a hit on him. If you're able to get the opportunity to attack his exposed behind however he’ll be stuck losing a lot of health. Aizawa's Special Action is unsurprisingly a huge counter against Compress, as not only does it allow for an easy attempt of his grounded Alpha with you not being able to block or fight back, but if you’re in your Gamma’s marble and become affected by it, you’ll be kicked out which ruins your momentum. Finding a good moment to use your Gamma in this fight can already be hard as well, as the pause before your teleport sets him up for an easy grab if you aren't careful. Aizawa's movement is nothing to scoff at either, being able to make good ground regardless if he's running from or chasing you.

Like when fighting most Alpha spam characters, an easy get around to a trigger happy Mic will be to reflect his Alpha with your Beta. This is especially important to do in this match up, as thanks to his Special Action Present Mics Alpha can easily stack up damage even faster than normal. Mic does have some counterplay here, as throwing his radio behind you will let it hit you since your back is turned to it. In close quarters Present Mic players will often go for his easy tap Beta into Gamma combo. If he starts with Beta you can actually block this and attempt to dodge his Gamma after or start stunning him if you're quick. Be careful if he expects this though, as if he does just Gamma he’ll punch you straight through your barrier. If you ever dodge his Gamma, its end lag gives you a good punish opportunity, or gives you time to Gamma away if you're in a bad spot. Just like his tap Beta, you can also block his charged Beta, which shouldn’t be too difficult as its long start up gives ample time for you to put up your Beta. In the event he does knock you down, watch for his tap Beta, as its stun will stop you from teleporting on wake up. In terms of movement, Mic is very outclassed against Compress, and you shouldn’t struggle to run or catch up to him.

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Despite his unique playstyle Cementoss will normally be a good match up for Compress. Both his Alpha and Gamma can be reflected while still in midair, meaning his combo game against Compress is much more limited as it relies on the stun from direct hits for max damage. If you're hit by Alpha or Gamma, recover/roll as fast as possible to try and prevent a follow up attack. Cementoss is great at creating his artificial high ground for both vertical movement and to create a safe spot to heal. Compress’ Gamma is an excellent counter to this however, as it can easily get you above Cementoss to rain Alphas on him. Watch for if he places a Gamma on top however, as it’ll block you from getting above him if you’re too close to the pillar. If he doesn't stack his pillars high enough  you actually won’t need Gamma at all, as simply throwing Alphas from the ground can still let you hit him thanks to the marble's arc and the projectile size. While this primarily covers the counter play outside, fighting Cementoss inside is not advised unless you already have a considerable advantage. His ability to block your exits combined with the fact his moves are super easy to hit inside, will put you at a big disadvantage.

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor struggles quite a bit in this match up. His Alpha, while capable of high damage if you aren't careful, is very easy to block and you can react to it after he gets a tick or two worth of hits. His Beta will be his most threatening move thanks to its very high damage, so reflecting it is instrumental in stopping Endeavor's offense. It does offer counterplay against your Beta though, as once it lands on a surface the pillar it makes can’t be blocked anymore. His Gamma is also not blockable. If he misses it or you catch an Endeavor using it against someone else however, him being stuck in the air gives you an excellent opportunity to spam Alphas into him. In the event he knocks you down, try to find cover before using Gamma to get away. Otherwise the pause before the teleport makes you an easy Beta target. The movement granted by Endeavor’s Special Action is far outclassed by Compress’ Gamma.

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Much like with Strike Endeavor, Inferno Fist’s Beta is the move you’ll want to watch for. Its spawn AOE and ability to drag you back inside can make for a lethal trap, so it's best to just Gamma out in most situations. If Inferno Fist tries to melt you with Alphas while you're stuck, reflect them with your Beta until he stops before you use Gamma to discourage him from following. If he tries to use his Gamma, teleport instantly to avoid it. In the event you don’t have Gamma available, you can reflect his Gamma too, but only while it's airborne. Once it hits the ground you’ll need to run. If you're ever in the open holding your Beta against him, be aware you’re an easy target for his Beta and that you’ll need to watch for it. His movement is the same as his base, so still not great.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Hawks only really has one good move in this match up and that is his Beta. Its near guaranteed shield break and being a super easy method to knock you down already make it great. The additional movement on hit it provides him is the cherry on top though, as Hawks become much harder to hit with his increased speed and can easily follow up on you. If he misses his first Beta it is easy to punish however. His slow moving auto-track Alpha sucks, and will do very little damage before you can react and block it. A Hawks who can quickly beam with the aimed version before moving again is much harder to react to. His Gamma is easy to dodge and reflectable too, so make sure to attempt the reflect whenever you see him do his spin. Even with his nerfs his movement is nothing to scoff at, and if you get outlined by his Gamma you may have difficulty running away.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Slicing Wind only really has one truly problematic move for Compress in his Gamma. Its combo potential, and large hitbox make it very dangerous if you can’t avoid it. Try and recover as quickly as possible to prevent follow ups if you're hit by this attack. Like most Alpha’s, Slicing Wind’s is reflected right back at him, so make sure you're ready to send them back at him when needed. His Beta is sort of an awkward move to characterize. While it is damaging if he lands it, it can be dodged fairly easily and leaves him very open to punish if he misses. His movement is quite good, comparable to Compress’, so it may be difficult to run or catch up to Slicing Wind if he has his cooldowns.

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Mt. Lady is an excellent close range fighter, and ideally someone you want to interact with from a nice middleground. This highly limits her damage options and forces her to make a play to try and get in which you can predict, or spam her Alpha which you can reflect. Highground is ideal though as it's much harder for her to reach and she wastes moves to get up. If Mt Lady ever gets too close to you, you should try and Gamma away since that's where she excels. Do be careful though, as her stomps can stun you out of it. If she ever knocks you down her Beta will be her best wake up catch option, so avoid that as best as possible. Her movement is quite poor, so you’ll outclass her there. Her giant form isn’t particularly bad unless you're right beside her making you an easy target. Her Alpha is incredibly easy to reflect thanks to its slow speed, and her Beta is easily dodged by teleporting into the air. Her Gamma will be the only real threat as its huge hitbox means you aren't safe in the sky. If she ever enters this mode, try your best to disengage as fast as possible, as her huge damage reduction and insane damage make winning a fight almost impossible if she's even kind of healthy. 

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Unfortunately for Shigiraki he really struggles to do much to Compress. His Alpha and Beta being grounded when Compress can easily fly into the air or get high ground with his Gamma means he lacks the ability to deal consistent damage to you. His Alpha also leaves him open to a counter attack since he's stationary using it. Even when you don’t have Gamma available, jumping over and over to stay off the ground until you get it back will negate some damage. You do need to keep in mind his Alpha and Beta can travel up surfaces though, so you aren't entirely safe when you are on top of buildings. If Shigiraki tries to Gamma you, dodge towards him so he runs right past you. It’ll grab you through your Gamma’s armor so using it won’t be a safe option to get away. His Gamma and Special Action being his movement sources means you won’t struggle to run or catch up to him. Shigiraki really isn't scary unless you’re in a small final circle or inside a building with him. Try and avoid those situations and he shouldn't be an issue.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Catastrophe is another character utilizing stuns like Compress. While you can reflect both his Alpha and Beta, he can easily get around this by throwing them at the ground instead to damage you. This means you’ll have to be smart using it, as just holding it out will invite unwanted damage while you do nothing back to him. If he's close to you Catastrophe can also go for his Gamma instead, allowing him to start his combos. If you’re ever hit by one of these combos you’ll also be taking a ton of damage which’ll force you to flee. Fortunately he isn’t too good at catching your wake up or stopping your Gamma. The best thing to try and do in this match up is just get the stun on him first if you're close, or stay above him and rain down your Alpha. Fortunately your Gamma is great movement against Catastrophe, so he can’t outrun or chase you well.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
When it comes to AFO’s base kit you’ll be having quite a back and forth match up. Like all Alphas if AFO spams it against you it’ll be very easy to reflect it back. You can reflect the charged version too, and thanks to its slow movement speed you can actually walk into its path on missed shots to ensure it's reflected. His Beta will be his counter to you, as it's quite large and can’t be reflected or blocked. Its ability to go through walls also gives AFO an option to stop you from following him in or out of buildings. His Gamma is a very back and forth move here. Dodging this move leaves AFO wide open to a counter attack or it’ll allow you an opportunity to escape him. Its lack of Armour also means you can stun him out of it if you're close enough. Mistiming a dodge however gives AFO a free combo which is almost guaranteed to do huge damage. This move also can’t be dodged while you’re in the air, which is a problem for Compress since he’s in it so often thanks to his Gamma. When approaching AFO or using Gamma in an area you know one is in, try when possible to make sure he’s already used his Gamma so you won’t be caught in it while airborne. His base kit doesn't have any movement. AFO’s stolen quirks will offer an additional challenge to you depending on what he has in the pocket. Any quirks that provide him movement will be what you want to watch for, as a 400HP character with the potential to run or catch up to you can make for a scary fight.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Compress’ Beta is a real pain for Young AFO to deal with. Like most, his Alpha will be reflected if he attempts to spam it against you, and the explosion afterward will be blocked as well. His uncharged Beta will also be blocked, however depending on your spacing the ball that lands behind you can still hit Compress’ back on occasion, so be wary. While his charged Beta does get around yours, Young AFO leaves himself open to be stunned when charging it, and its slow fall time also gives you opportunity to run away if he gets it off. The real issue with Young AFO however is just how hard it is to actually fight back against him when he’s in the air. While in his Gamma, he can get incredibly high up, making it almost impossible to fight back from the ground, especially since he can constantly knock you down with Gamma energy blasts. While these too can be reflected by Beta, it really limits your options as you're more or less forced to run so you don’t get hit by the charged Gamma’s large radius. His Beta allowing him to hover, alongside his Special Action flight, allows him to stay high up for an even longer time. While you can get decently high up yourself, you don't float like he does and his Gamma armor stops you stunning him too. He becomes even more oppressive alongside teammates who make the ground unsafe. His Special Action alone is also a very good movement tool to help him escape from or chase you.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Dabi is another character who really just can’t touch Compress outside of close range. Engage Dabi from a mid range or from above and he shouldn’t be an issue. Although his Alpha tracks you, its slow speed makes it very easy to dodge, and even easier to reflect. His Beta only deals damage when you run over it, so watch for where he places it in a fight. Your Alpha is great at setting them off from range, as the large projectile size and shockwave can both set them off. Dabi’s Beta can also eat projectiles to protect himself. Unfortunately for Dabi, this only includes the marble portion of your Alpha since the object persists until it touches the ground. While the object will fly past if he remains inside the trap's radius, if he continues to run he might get hit anyway. If you chase Dabi into a building his traps will be a much bigger problem in the enclosed space. He can also use them to block exits to stop you fleeing. His Gamma is his best tool against Compress thanks to it actually fully blocking your Alpha. If you're outside, simply Gamma over it to rain Alphas from above. If Gamma is unavailable he still can’t do much to you since as long as you're outside the radius, his Alpha is his only option to hit you. Inside buildings his Gamma is much better since you can’t teleport over it, and it can go through walls to hit you on the other side. He doesn’t have movement to run or chase.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Crazy Torch’s simple game plan of run up and Beta you can work both great and poorly against Compress. On one hand he becomes very easy to predict, often running at you in a straight line and inviting you to stun them with Alpha. You can even stun him out of his Beta before he hits you. Getting stunned like this while also draining their own HP if their Gamma is active puts Crazy Torch in a very bad spot. If he can hit you though, Compress can really struggle since the grab knocks you down on hit. Compress hates these wake up catch scenarios, and Crazy Torch is great at them thanks to his Betas tracking. If you try and Gamma  he can just Beta you again to either DOWN you or get you very low. It's very important to keep track of how many Beta’s Crazy Torch has (max 2), because if you’re alive after the second one is used you know he can’t catch you anymore and you can Gamma away. His Gamma is another good counter to you though, as the small fire shockwaves it produces will block your Alpha from hitting him, and also all but guarantee you won’t be able to finish a combo on him thanks to it knocking you away if you're going for a melee. His alpha isn't very problematic for you, and his Beta being his movement means his best offense is wasted if he uses it to run.

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Togas Beta will be her best move in this fight. Its quick movement speed and ability to knock you down even through your Gamma’s armor can make it difficult to counter. You can stun her out of this move however, so if you dodge it try and either punish her with Alphas or Gamma to distance yourself. Her Alpha has a shockingly long range for what it is, so you're not safe just because you’re out of her Beta distance. It can also stack damage fast if you aren’t careful, so make sure to reflect it when possible. Toga’s Gamma can be blocked by your Beta, so always try and stop it when it comes out. If you don't, she'll be able to either refresh cancel her abilities similar to Monoma, or can chase or run using your own mobility. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Sting Dance is another hard to hit aerial character that Compress struggles with. Thanks to her fantastic air mobility, Sting dance is often darting around above you and not giving many opportunities to counter attack her until she's back on the ground. While her Alpha is reflectable and her Gamma can be blocked, her Beta can bypass it and stun you, allowing for an easy Gamma follow up from her. You especially don’t want Sting Dance to start cooldown refreshing as normally her moves won’t start reloading until she's touched the ground. Giving her the option to reset in the air is not good. While she's in the air it's best to just try and dodge her until she makes a mistake or runs out of moves and is forced to land. If she misses a Gamma for example, she's slow to recover, which gives you the chance to try and stun her. You can also get into the air yourself using Gamma, which will prevent her Beta from hitting you since it only hits below her. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
The match up against Mr. Compress is not kind to Twice at all. For starters he’s one of the four characters who can have all of their moves stopped by Compress’ Beta. Simply holding out your Beta to Twice almost completely stops him. His only real option is to try and melee you, which isn't a terrible option thanks to the slide making it hit from an unexpected distance. Learn to expect this and dodge it, and Twice is incredibly punishable on a miss. The only other way for him to get around this is to hope a clone of a player he previously downed counters Compress. His alpha is reflected, his Beta can be blocked, and the clones low health means its Alpha spam will kill itself if it is summoned. His Gamma is also blocked, and is also pretty poor for movement. Just wait for a mistake, and Twice can virtually never win this fight.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
 Due to the threat of your Compress’ Alpha stun, a lot of this match up can be spent with both parties holding their own Beta and trying to predict when the other will drop theirs. If you want to aggress in this situation, try closing the distance on your mirror but in a diagonal line so you’re harder to hit, and throw some jumps in there as well. From here, you can stagger Alphas to try and predict the enemy dropping their Beta. Approaching on a diagonal while jumping ensures any reflected Alphas don’t stun you back as long as you aren't too close. If you predict right you can start your own Alpha combo. If that's too risky for you, another option is to play it safe by attempting to react to them dropping their Beta instead and then using Alpha, but this will require a quick reaction time. Some Compress players are very wary of opposing Alphas, and may not drop their Beta at all. In these situations you’re more or less forced to close the distance to start potential melee combos. If you're on the defense it's best to keep your Beta up like this. If an attempt to close ground for a melee is made you can use your Gamma, as its armor will protect you from any melee stun and will damage your opponent back with the smoke bomb. You can also roll out of Beta, so consider rolling backwards and then using Alpha to stun an opponent stuck in the melee animation. Always remember an enemy Compress could do this to you when you approach them too. You may also be tempted to Gamma into the air and use Alpha from above. You should always try and be the second Compress to do this though. Assuming your opponent Gammas into the air, you can Gamma up after them immediately. This prevents them from hitting you while they’re above, and makes you harder to hit and locate in general. If they choose to go higher with their second Gamma, go up after them again. This leaves you as the Compress with the high ground as your opponent is stuck falling below you, and they can only try and Beta to save themselves. This also gives you a good opportunity to land on them for an easy melee combo. If you went up first, they could do this to you. Because your movement is the same, the previous idea also applies here. If you're the first to Gamma away, the other Compress can always catch you, so try and force the other to run first. For the most part you want to try and use Gamma second.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kurogiri is the final character who is completely stopped by your Beta. Against your Beta his Alpha will be reflected, and his Beta will be blocked. This means just like Twice you can more or less just wait for him to make a mistake to punish him. Kurogiri is another one of the characters who can just outrun Compress if he’s put on the back foot however, as his portals go crazy distances you just can’t keep up with. Additionally, if a Kurogiri is able to hit you with his Beta, locking you into something like his quad Beta combo does absolutely ridiculous damage and will immediately put you at a major disadvantage. Even some of his other combos can be quite threatening. If he ever sends his Gamma ball after you keep in mind his Alphas will be blocked rather than reflected. This means you will have to shoot it down, which fortunately isn't too hard with your Alpha's massive size. If Kurogiri is trying to air stall in his Gamma, Gamma up after him and hit him while he's stuck up there to try and force him down.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Overhaul is another fairly grounded character who can struggle against Compress’ aerial movement. Staying on top of high ground or in the air above him will be your best option, as this invalidates pretty much his whole kit. While he can semi-counter you sitting on high ground with his Beta, he struggles to follow up on any damage he deals this way. His Gamma will be his scariest move, as it stops you from using your own Gamma if it catches you, and can combo into itself or any of his other moves. It's also very good for catching your wake up if he ever knocks you down. He does pause to use both his Beta and Gamma however, so if he ever misses these attacks you can punish him with Alpha stuns. His Special Action can end any melee combos you attempt on him so there's no point in using that as a punish option unless you know he's used it up. He can also heal up for free using it, making it a bit harder to take him down. Like most grounded characters, Overhaul will only get the upper hand on you when fighting in small or enclosed spaces where his Gamma is easy to hit. Avoiding these situations is the key to success when fighting Overhaul.
