Strike hawks is a highly mobile character that is incredibly efficient at killing the enemy. He mainly focuses on positioning himself in ways to get the jump on the opponent and outright killing them for it. This character is also a super level reliant character being nearly incapable of preforming well without high levels so if your super aggressive early game this character may not he for you. This character also has a insanely high skill ceiling and is not a character that is easily picked up. Playing this character without strong knowledge of every little advantage you can get will probably just get you killed.

## Alpha Skill - Cold Wind

</p>

**The alpha has 3 main modes. Tap, hold, and tornado.**
Tap alpha is a standard projectile that is rather weak at first glance but it has some properties that make it really strong. Tap alpha carries your momentum super well making the skill a great mobility tool and tap alpha staggers grounded opponents that are on hp and knocks opponents down when they are in the air. This makes the skill a fantastic anti air ability and great at securing people that are running away thanks to the grounded stagger and disruption it causes. Its also worth noting that when aiming this skill against a target that is in the air aim below them since the hitbox upwards is massive. When using this skill for mobility dont spam it too much and instead dely your shots slightly. Tap alpha has a faster fire rate when you are grounded.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold alpha is a aoe tool primarily used to start combos. This version has some consistency issues when used against targets in the air so its recommend that you use this skill primarily against grounded targets. Its recommended to aim slightly below their feet so that the tornados hit the ground before hitting the opponent. Most of the time the best use case for this skill is simply area denial in more open areas as it provides visual clutter and long lasting large hitboxes. Worth noting that this skill only gets the 3 tornados at lv7. For this reason i recommend to not use hold alpha basically ever until you have alpha 7

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301a2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Tornado is when you aim straight up or down with hold alpha causing all 3 of the smaller tornados to combine into one massive tornado. Due to the nature of needing all 3 tornados this is again only lv7 and beyond. This skills primary use cases are in more enclosed areas as a area denial tool, finishing downed people, and in certain matchups against characters with down power reduction like rapid all might and young afo. This will essentially place a giant slow moving projectile on the ground that will do 170 damage and hard knock which can make you very hard to approach if used properly.

## Beta skill: Wind-Cleaving Blade
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/Variation/Var01/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch043_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Probably the simplest move in the kit. This is your combo starter, your combo ender, your primary damage, your mobility even. This is your most important ability. 

Ill start by mentioning that you should almost never hold this down as charging the skill has no difference in any of its stats.
When starting combos with this skill its important to mention that you should position yourself at the beta skills maximum range as this is the only range where beta will consistently combo into other abilities outside of alpha. The skill is also easily rolled after the first 10 damage it if you are to close to the opponent.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The use of this skill for mobility is also very limited due to its massive endlag so dont use this skill when trying to escape a opponent unless you know for sure they dont have the ability to hit you. 

The direction this skill sends after connected is partially determined by where the opponent is hit. As for forward and backwards its kinda random but for left to right the skill tries to send the user twards the center of the skill so if you hit directly on the opponent will always be sent either straight forward or backwards but if you hit slightly to the left the opponent will be sent to the left with how sharp the angle is depending on how far to the left that they were hit. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301b2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

This skill gets super armor and a damage spike of 9 damage at lv7. The primary reason to level this skill is for the super armor. Getting this skill to 12 damage serves little purpose for this reason as you dont even get a cooldown buff or hitbox buff at lv9.

## Gamma: Spiral Slash

</p>

**This skill has 2 versions to go over being tap and hold gamma.**
Tap gamma is the primary way to use this skill for mobility since it acts as momentum amplifier which lets you carry high speed momentum and make it even faster such as with his special action. See movement techs for more info. Tap gamma has applications in combos too due to its lower down power value which lets it do combos that hold gamma cannot do.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Hold gamma, this version is primarily used for damage. This skill has mobility applications however thats very niche and generally outclassed by other ways of gaining hight and distance however it can rarely come up. This version of gamma however is way better for damage since it has more tracking than tap gamma and is a lingering hitbox that easily catches rolls and its your best combo starter when your in a closer range. Important to note than when using the skill for damage do not use movement inputs and instead just hold the gamma. 
If you move to much you risk the opponent falling out of the gamma. See combos for more info 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Special action:
This skill is your primary momentum gain however its also his most limited ability. A big part of this characters skill ceiling is making sure you always have this avaliable and never let it go to penalty cooldown as the massive 19 second penalty reload hurts and often means death. That said proper use of this skill can turn you into one of if not the hardest character to hit with alphas in the entire game so keep that in mind. The pickup version of this skill is niche but has its uses especially when playing in stacks. When using this skill in combination with alpha its important to note that your momentum will be stopped if you use alpha after the first initial boost the gane automatically does. For this reason either do the alpha super early or use gamma.
See mobility techs for more info

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301s-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

## Melee:
Melee is a great option for catching wakeups as its long linger and crazy tracking is strong for catching people that are already weak from a previous combo. Theres also combo starter and ender applications for this skill but those are generally harder techs to preform and often redundant. Use this skill when you dont need much damage to finish off the opponent or dont have gamma up. Otherwise use gamma as gamma can combo start and leave a much bigger scratch on the enemy while effectively doing the same thing as ground melee.

</p>

Its important to note the reasoning behind each spike in power and why they need levels. <br>
**Alpha:**
- More damage
- Extra ammo
- Bigger hitbox 
- Tornado at lv7

**Beta**
- More damage
- Armor at lv7

**Gamma**
- More damage
- 2nd charge at lv4
- Massive damage spike at lv7
- CD buff at lv9 

With this knowledge in mind i will start by saying that gamma 4 is a must. That is the first thing you should do and should generally avoid any fighting until you have that 2nd charge.

Beta 9 is also extremely hard to suggest since you dont get any benefit outside of 4 damage for levels 8 and 9 which given how much his combos do that isn't that useful so any levels twards beta after beta 7 are better spent on other things.

**Heres a few level paths.**

### Generalist.
 This specializes in being good at all ranges

     <img tag="lvlup" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/Y9.png" width="45" />
</p>
The rest of the levels could be given to teamates. As for beta or gamma 7 first generally id suggest to get beta first if possible but if your about to enter a fight and cant get beta 7 but can get gamma 7 then get gamma 7 as it will help you survive in the moment and eventually snowball into beta 7 later.

### Combo path. 
This path specializes in making your combos as impactful as possible as early as possible but in the process sacrifices some mobility and ranges potency alpha levels provide.

</p>

he rest of the levels could be given to teamates again. There really aren't any other level paths i can suggest. I personally like the generalist one best since i find even lv1 beta and lv4 gamma does enough damage in the combos to be impactful and the alpha damage, ammo, and ability to quick kill downed people to be more useful.

## Techs 
### Mobility techs
#### Boost gamma.
By expending 40% of your special action and a gamma charge you can get what is likley the fasted momentum in the entire game without tuning or weird glitches. Simply start your flight, input a boost, and immediately as the boost starts tap gamma. This will shoot you so fast that you will often go into storm in later zones bases solely on the speed sending you to far. Use this to escape fights you dont want to be in anymore but dont spam it as its high special cost can be draining quick.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### Special cancel:
By tapping special and inputting a alpha or gamma you will get a sizable speed boost that can be chained over and over if needed to. Use a air melee right before landing for a bit of extra distance. The speed is nowhere comparable to boost gamma but this still is super useful especially when combined with the following tech

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### Special conservation:
By doing the previous tech with fast enough inputs you can actually get the boost without putting your special on a penalty reload start span (the time it takes to begin reloading again) which makes the above tech nearly infinite when used properly. Proper use of this tech is nearly mandatory to succeed at this character at a ace level. This tech can be preformed with alpha, gamma, and air melee, all of which having their own uses.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### Moon jump gamma:
This is a tech exclusive to the wall runner passive provided from rapid card effects and the wall runner tuning perk. By inputting a neutral jump off a wall and clicking gamma you get a unbelievable amount of hight. By doing super jumps sideways and using the tech you can also get a sizable speed boost that way. Proper use of this tech is basically mandatory to survive when you dont have access to your special action.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### Off spawn special
Your special action wont drain in the first 3 seconds of the game so use that to get far away from your spawn spot if needed 

### Other techs
#### Melee cancel.
By delaying your melee 2 for as long as you can you can cancel it with a movement input which lets you do some combos off melee that are not normally possible. Generally however save this for last as its much less useful to learn than the mobility techs.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t5-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### Tornado:
By looking straight up or down you can create a giant tornado that is extremely good at finishing downed people and covering area. The best combos for finishing downed people are, tornado tech twice or, tornado tech, hold gamma, alpha tap. Both of these work with 714 levels and are very efficient.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t6-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

#### I frames tech
By using your special action in invincibility from say a knockdown you will not lose your i frame early unlike most actions. Use this to get out of nasty wakeup setups like shinso space hop beta

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301t7-gif.gif" width="400" />

## Combos 
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Endeavor's abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: 200 DP (Hold), 85 DP (Tap)<br>
Beta Skill: 0 DP (Mid-Air), 50 DP (Rush)<br>
Gamma Skill: ?????????????????????<br>
Ground Melee: ?????????????????????????<br>
Air Melee: ??????????????????????<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### Alpha-alpha-alpha.
This works against grounded targets on hp and is completely true. Alphas fire rate is faster when grounded but the combo is still true even when airborn its just a bit harder.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Hold alpha-beta/gamma/alpha-alpha
You can use beta, gamma, or alpha in this combo but this is just your traditional hold alpha starter combos. Cant be done off the tornado tech however due to down power restrictions and the last alpha may not work if you get one to many ticks of the hold alpha. Overall strong option.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c2-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta alpha alpha
This combo is primarily used when you land beta in a range thats unfavorable to go for a gamma or melee followup. Its a strong and consistent option.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c3-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta-hold gamma
This is a traditional combo in the kit with high damage. Its consistent but only when using beta from its max range. If your too close you risk beta sending in a direction that makes the combo unfavorable.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c4-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta-gamma-alpha
Very simular to the previous combo just with a bit more damage in exchange for being less pratical due to tap gammas limited tracking.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c5-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta-beta-alpha/gamma
This combo is the highes damaging combo but is also extremely expensive putting your beta on a 10 sec penalty CD which can be very bad to do if you do it too often. Its great against highly durable characters like tech shigaraki and is also great when your beta hits multiple people as it will combo them all.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c6-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta-full melee
You dont get the full melee here and the range where this works is limited. Generally use beta gamma over this.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c7-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta-melee1-air melee-alpha
This is one of the most ammo to damage effective combos in his kit but is also really restrictive in its range so i dont recommend this very much.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c8-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma-alpha-alpha and Gamma hold-alpha
Very simular combo. Do gamma alpha alpha on hp and gamma hold alpha on gp since you can only get the 2nd alpha if the opponent doesn't tech. This is your primary gamma combo starter if you dont have beta to combo after. 
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma-beta-alpha
This one is quite weird to do since it doesn't work on gp unless you hit the gamma in a specific way. For this reason id suggest using the following combo more

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/4301c11-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma hold-beta
This is just the previous combo with slightly less damage but much better consistency on gp so use this one more when you do a gamma combo starter.

<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/????-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma hold-air melee-alpha
This one is super niche and hard to do but technically does exist so here it is.

</p>

When playing this character you want to try to position yourself in a few key ranges being right at the edge of beta range, very close to the opponent for gamma, or very far for alpha staggers. Which is best for the situation changes heavily but with your super good movement you should be able to switch between the 3 at will. Just keep in mind your opponents effective range when picking Which range to start the fight at. Dont wana be in gamma starter range against a assualt kiri for example.

This character is extremely good at positioning himself for teamheals especially when combined with divine protection. Dont be afraid to drop a kill if it means you can position for a teamheal to save your team. 
This character can also very effectively use revive cards as with his superior mobility he is very tough to kill so if the fight is beyond saving run away and come back later. Chances are even if they are still on the body you will be able to get the tag and get away with minimal risk.
This character thrives as a support damage hybrid character for the reasons listed above. Learning how to tone it back on the aggression for the sake of your team is very important.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;"> Strike: Kendo, Kirishima, Present Mic, Endeavor, and any alpha dmg tunes are all great options.</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">Assualt: Endeavor, All Might, Shigaraki, then any alpha or beta def tunes. Hp def is king so use that first always.</a><br>
<a style="color: cyan !important;">Rapids: Bakugo, All Might, Rapid Deku, Twice, Toga. All of these except rapidgo aren't that useful but i listed them all as the rest of the rapid tunes currently are almost entirely useless.</a><br>
<a style="color: lime !important;">Supports: overhaul..... thats it. Overhaul is the only one that needs mentioning here. Outside of him if you have extra green slots just use more max hp/gp tunes</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">Tech: Denki, Shigaraki, AFO, Mirio, Shoto. Alpha dmg and hp def should be the priorities for the tech slots</a><br>
