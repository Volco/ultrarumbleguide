# <a style="color: rgba(255,245,138,255) !important;">T.U.N.I.N.G.: Learning How It Works</a><br>
In this sub-guide you'll learn about what's the T.U.N.I.N.G. System and how to use it! And for the wellbeing of our sanity we will remove the dots and call it Tuning!

# What is the T.U.N.I.N.G. System

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/tuningmats.png" width="80%"/>
</p>

Tuning is a game system that allows players to create unique builds that significantly increase their character's power, defense, supportive capabilities, and mobility. It offers a wide variety of effects, from minor stat increases to those that completely change how you play.

Each tuning build is exclusive to the outfit you apply it to, meaning you’ll have to equip the character's tuning by going to your chosen outfit and selecting “Tuning Equip”.

In simple terms, this system allows the player to equip 10 small buffs (each with 1-2 attributes, such as Alpha DMG, Defense against Gamma skills, more health, etc...) and 2 small passive abilities known as Special Tunes.

</p>

# How to tune a character
To tune a character, you must first select the costume you wish to tune. Keep in mind that PUR and non-PUR costumes have different tuning effectiveness, which will be discussed later.

After opening the menu, you will see two sets of tuning slots. The five smaller slots are arranged in a row, with a single large, special tuning slot above them. The small slots are referred to as Normal Tuning Slots and the large ones are referred to as Special Tuning Slots.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/tuningtuto3.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

What you want to do is fill the left column column first (except the Special Tuning slot at the top), to do that just click a slot and pick one of the buffs in the right side. You can only equip them if you have 50 Character Data or Character Data Exchange Tickets, the latter can replace normal Character Data if you don't have enough, but only for characters you own, for characters you don't own however you rely on luck to get enough of their Character Data from playing matches (which is how you obtain these materials).

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/characterdata.png" width="20%"/>
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Currency/T_ui_Thumb_2_40000_S.webp" width="20%"/>
</p>

When attempting to fill these slots you have to keep this in mind:

- Each slot has a color that matches one of the 5 classes, you can only equip tunes of battle styles that match that class, so red slots only support strike tunes.
- You cannot equip Normal or Special tunes that match your character, so Bakugo can't equip neither Strike Bakugo's nor Rapid Bakugo's tuning.
- You cannot equip the same tuning twice in the same build.
- Some slots might be locked, to unlock them you need Slot Unlock Keys, if you have enough you can unlock a slot. On PUR Costumes only the right side is locked, while in Non-PUR costumes some slots in the left side are locked.
- Some slots might have an H (Hero) or a V (Villain), which means you can only equip either heroes or villains in those. Villain slots are particularily hard to fill due to the lack of villain battle styles this game has.
- If you don't have 50 of a character's data or 50 character data exchange tickets, you can use Hero Crystals instead, but this is NOT recommended, as Hero Crystals have way better uses.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/tuningtuto4.png" width="60%"/>
</p>

Once you've filled the left column, you will be able to setup the left column's special tuning (since special tunings can only be placed on columns that have all 5 slots filled), filling these takes 100 Character Data / Character Data Exchange Tickets, and instead of just having small buffs to specific stats, they have special effects, like Willpower which let's you survive a deadly hit at 1 HP, or Wall Runner that let's you run up walls.

To level up Normal Tunes you need Tuning Slot Enhancement Pieces (also known as white pieces), while for Special Tunes you need Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Pieces (black ones for Non-PUR costumes, rainbow ones for PUR costumes).

You can do all of this in the right column too, but you will have to unlock all slots in that one with keys (except the special one). Some locked slots in the right side (mainly in PUR costumes) have written on them "MAX LVL", this means that once you unlock that slot the max level of your special tunings will increase by 1, so you will be able to level them up again. In PUR costumes, unlocking slots also unlocks auras.

## Normal Tuning Slot
When you set tuning data in one of these normal slots, it grants your character a small passive effect. Each Normal Tuning Slot can be enhanced using Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts. The maximum level for a Normal Tuning Slot is 3, though certain slots can be upgraded to level 4. This is marked by either an H (Hero) or V (Villain) icon on the slot

Here is a small table to show you the effects of normal tuning slots:

## Special Tuning Slot
The large tuning slot above the five normal ones is called the “Special Tuning Slot”. It grants your character a small passive ability when specific conditions are met. The Special Tuning Slots are a crucial factor in deciding which costume to tune. You can only fill these if the Normal Tunes below are filled. They require 100 Character Data / Character Data Exchange Tickets to fill, and can be leveled up with Special Tuning Slot Parts (black for non-PUR, rainbow for PUR).

Special tunes can be leveled to different levels depending on the costume's rarity:
- For C and R costumes, the max level is Level 2 (left) and Level 3 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slot will allow you to push this to Level 3 (left) and Level 4 (right).
- For SR costumes, the max level is Level 3 (left) and Level 4 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slot will allow you to push this to Level 4 (left) and Level 5 (right).
- For PUR Costumes, the max level is Level 6 (left) and Level 7 (right), but unlocking the MAX LVL slots will allow you to push this to Level 10 (left) and Level 11 (right).
  
## Unlocking Slots
At first, the right column of Normal Tuning slots and both Special Tuning Slots are fully locked on Plus Ultra Rare costumes. To unlock each Normal Tuning Slot, you must use Slot Unlock Keys. Special Tuning Slots will be unlocked automatically after all five normal slots get filled with the data. Alternatively, any copies you get of a costume will unlock another slot. This is a rather unreliable way compared to keys unless you’re pulling on a banner with that specific costume and you get that costume again by sheer luck, this shouldn't be done on purpose though.

While using keys, the cost for unlocking slots depends on the rarity of the costume:
- C and R costumes require 1 Key to unlock each slot.
- SR costumes require 5 Keys to unlock each slot.
- PUR costumes require 50 keys to unlock each slot.

As said earlier, unlocking slots raises your special tuning max level (if you unlocked a "MAX LVL" slot) and grants you an extra aura (PUR Costumes only).<br>
<br>
Slots you've unlocked in one costume automatically unlock for all other 5 color variations of that particular costume.

</h2>
This resource is used to upgrade the Special Tuning Slots on PUR costumes. Its primary source is the Hero License, though you also receive 100 of them from the Beginner Missions. Unlike the non-PUR enhancement parts, these 100 items will most likely be spent within a couple of seasons, as you need significantly more of them to fully tune a costume. The main sources are:<br>

    Character Data
    <img class="role-image" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/refs/heads/main/images/characterdata.png" />
</h2>
Character Data is used to fill both Normal and Special Tuning Slots. When placed into a suitable slot, it grants your character the effect stated in its description. You get 10-75 per match depending on your performance.

<h2 class="role-heading">
    Character Data Exchange Ticket
    <img class="role-image" src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Currency/T_ui_Thumb_2_40000_S.webp" />
</h2>
Character Data Exchange Tickets may be used instead of usual character data in case if you lack it, but unfortunately, it can’t be used if you currently don’t own the character whose data you want to set. You get 10-75 per match depending on your performance.

# Tuning Economy
You have probably noticed that you get a limited amount of tuning material each season. If we sum up every replenishable source of materials, you will get exactly:
- 5400 Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts (5,4 tuned PUR costumes)
- 27 Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts (5 tuned costumes)
- 60 Special Tuning Slot Enhancement Parts PUR (3,16 tuned costumes)
- 1050 Slot unlock keys (4,2 tuned costumes)
Keep in mind that you receive 400 Slot Unlock Keys from claiming all the daily Premium Login bonuses. This makes purchasing the Premium Login extra valuable for your tuning progression.
The 650 keys you get without it only allow you to tune about 2.6 costumes per season, which is almost half the capacity.

# Character Data Economy

A major challenge for all new players is acquiring Character Data. In the early stages of the game, you own very few characters. This means you not only receive less desirable data from matches, but you also cannot use Universal Data to "craft" the specific data you need for your build, making every piece of useful data extremely valuable. However, the system requires you to fill all five Normal Tuning Slots to unlock the Special Tuning Slot.
Therefore, a crucial tip for all new players is to never use the Character Data of a character you currently don’t own. While generally unadvisable, the data for certain characters can be considered expendable, even if you don't own them. Below is a list of characters with comparably weak Special Tuning Skills and whose data you can freely spend as a filler.

## True Fillers
Character data from the list below may be used freely as filler, as their special Tuning effects are severely underwhelming. 
- Shoto Todoroki (Default)
- Shoto Todoroki (Ice Fang Wind Flame)
- Momo Yaoyorozu
- Denki Kaminari (Default)
- Tsuyu Asui
- Eijiro Kirishima (Default)

## Semi-Fillers
Character Data from this list may have an underwhelming Special Effect, but solid normal effect, or its special effect may have some use in specific builds. Using this data filler is unrecommended, unless it isn’t your only option. A good tip for these is to always have 100 of this data for future possible builds.
- Katsuki Bakugo (Machine Gun)
- Itsuka Kendo (Twin Palm Strike)
- Mirio Togata (Default)
- Nejire Hado
- Present Mic
- Dabi (Crazy Torch)
- Mr. Compress
- Kurogiri
