Froppy or Tsuyu, is a rapid-class character with a wide range of playstyles suited to many different people. Your main objective is to find the balance between dealing damage and supporting your team through your revives, which may completely shift the tide of a battle. Due to her close range attacks as Beta and Melee, your job is to close distance quickly with the help of your mobility, and Alpha Skill. 

As one of the characters with the lowest HP pool in the game, you are an easy target and can be eliminated easily by many opponents. To counter this, you must make full use of your mobility - taking advantage of every movement option and your surroundings, controlling the space around you.

## Alpha Skill - Ribbit Shot

Froppy’s Alpha Skill is an interesting and highly powerful ability. It features 2 modes: a projectile when used on the ground, and a grapple when used in mid-air.

</p>

The projectile fires one single shot that will only hit an enemy if aimed directly at them, while still pulling you towards the target if you were in the air during the attack. When used in air, Froppy can grapple onto anything around her, giving her exceptional mobility and versatility in any situation, as well as the ability to close distance quickly.  

### When can you use ground Alpha and grapple Alpha?

Ground Alpha is usually paired with aim mode (right-click hold) and is best used from mid-long range, from high ground, or to hit opponents while they are in air. It functions like a snipe style attack and should only be used when your surroundings are relatively safe - don’t use mid-battle.

</p>

With Froppy, your gameplay revolves around staying in air and controlling your movement based on the situation. In most cases, you will be using aerial Alpha, allowing you to grapple toward opponents and shortening distance for close- range fights. You will have to evaluate when it’s safe to continue approaching - such as when an opponent is low HP - or when to change your trajectory mid-air and seek for a better moment to approach.

### Value your ammo

At level 1, Froppy starts with 3 Alpha charges, which might seem sufficient at first glance. However, in a real match they run out quickly, especially when you’re traversing the map, chasing, running away or dodging enemy projectiles. 
Using your Alpha on the ground leaves you vulnerable for a second or two (the tongue needs time to fold back), giving enemies an opening to punish you. Missing an aerial Alpha is _____ (extremely, but I said the word previously) punishing - you will enter a stun like state, falling entirely to the ground, before you can jump again and attempt another grapple, while being left with 2 charges or less.

</p>

When all 3 Alpha charges are spent, your mobility becomes extremely limited, and the skill takes a long time to fully recharge. Because of this, it’s usually best to keep at least one charge available. 

### Aim and improvisation  

After an Alpha is fired, it instantly connects with the enemy or pulls you toward a surface with no delay. Due to the terrain varying greatly on all 3 maps, it is important to learn how to quickly evaluate your surroundings, so you can choose the best grapple points and control your distance effectively. Froppy’s Alpha skill gains an increase in distance at levels 4, 7 and 9, with level 9 giving a noticeable range increase. Don’t hesitate to enter training mode and move around the map, trying different grapple options, testing range and practicing your aim as you play. Accept misses and constantly improve.

### Limitations
Although the Alpha Skill is powerful and versatile, its negative aspects are ineviatble. If you fire and the shot ends up out of range, you will enter the same short stun state until Froppy’s tongue returns, preventing you from using abilities during that time. Additionally, Alpha ability cannot pierce defensive abilities such as Momo’s shield, Kirishima’s beta and others. In that case, the tongue will hit the barrier, will not connect, and still take time to come back -  putting you into the stun state again.
