Present Mic is a high damage strike character with some of the highest DPS in the game, his gameplay is centered in absolutely melting the enemies from afar and upclose, using different tools to achieve this in each range, as well as the ability to apply a deafen debuff to impair the enemy's ability to hear their surroundings.

## Alpha Skill - Shouting Voice

</p>
This is Present Mic's primary DPS tool and one of the best alphas in the game, it has an incredible range and deals outstanding DMG when paired with his Special Action. The damage of this ability decreases with distance, the farther away you are, the less damage it does, but in exchange, the projectile becomes bigger, so from upclose he does high DMG with a smaller projectile hitbox, while to far away targets he does less damage but it's easier to hit. Even then, he doesn't lose much damage at range, especially with his Special Action up.

## Beta Skill #1 - Loud Voice

Present Mic's beta skill (tap) is his primary combo starter and also benefits from his Special Action. It deals decently high DMG and stuns the enemy shortly, which acts as a setup for your high damage combos. It's also a very annoying skill, as it inflicts "Deafen" to the enemy, which makes them unable to hear anything except for a ringing noise, which can make it harder for them to accurately predict threats, as they won't be able to use sound to guess your position. It doesn't have insane range, but it does have more range than most people think. It also has the benefit of hitting around courners, as the object collision hitbox is smaller than the damaging hitbox.

## Beta Skill #2 - Big Bang Voice

When holding his beta skill, Present Mic will cast this variation instead, where he sends huge soundwaves that have outstanding range. It's a phenomenal 3rd party tool that has great zoning when combined with his Special Action, but it's also his most punishable move. There are several ways to use this ability, the best way to me is to third party, or use it for area denial with Special Action. If aimed properly it can down fleeing targets with exceptional range, can guardbreak a whole team if caught unaware, and can zone out long range characters, an incredibly valuable move that's either overused by novice players or underused by standard players.

## Gamma Skill - DJ Punch

By far the most valuable part of his kit, getting this to level 4 is absolutely essential. It is a powerful forward-lunging punch with the unique trait that increases damage if allies are DOWNd or KOd. The most obvious way to use this is in conjunction with the beta, BUT that is not the only way, albeit a bit rare you can air melee into this, it might not be generally worth it but if you need to finish someone off without using a beta or don’t have one, this can be a solution. The best way to use this move is obviously to either beta combo into it or reposition with it, as it is solid mobility that hits like a truck. Even tho it makes you glow, this move isn't armored. A trick you can do that can get you some extra KOs is to, if you hit this move raw, you can chain an alpha after if the opponent has no GP.

## Special Action - Radio Noise

Present Mic's Special Action is a very good move that on one hand has a high skill ceiling with proper placement, but also highly rewards just chucking this at the enemy. The BoomBox will copy your sound-based moves, meaning that when using an alpha, a tap beta or a hold beta, the BoomBox will do the same, aiming at the position you're aiming at. This results in a high increase in damage, and what makes Present Mic a true menace. The device has an incredibly low health, most characters can break it in one hit, which is why, along with repositioning, he has 3 uses. Proper box placement is required to get good with Present Mic, high vantage points or behind enemy’s are the best, especially if they have a shield, this move almost completely negates Assault Kendo’s shield, as you can throw the BoomBox behind and have it shoot at her back while you shoot the front. Keep in mind that placement can't be tricky, because of enemies leaving the area, obstacles, or tricky terrain such as slopes, all which can make it difficult for their attacks to reach the enemy. To avoid some of the issues with BoomBox placement, one can place it above trees or at the very edge of buildings at the top, as that way the projectiles won't hit the building's floor.

<br>
Alpha Skill: 100 DP (Normal Shot), 70 DP (Special Action's Shot)<br>
Beta Skill #1: 250 DP (Normal Shot), 100 DP (Special Action's Shot)<br>

The DMG of the following combos is classified under the tags "Basic DMG", "Light DMG", "Medium DMG", "High DMG", "Heavy DMG" and "Deadly DMG", given to combos that at max level do damage in the 100s, 200s, 300s, 400s, 500s and 600s respectively.

### (Special Action) -> Beta 1 -> Gamma
Present Mic's most well known combo, which warrants a ton of damage on the enemy, especially if one or both allies are DOWNd or KOd. This combo's power can be amplified via Special Action and/or DOWNd/KOd allies.

</p>

### Beta 1 -> Alpha -> (Alpha) -> (Alpha)
A beta combo that uses alpha instead of the usual gamma. While by default this does less damage than Beta 1 into gamma, it also allows you to instantly shoot another 2 alphas right after for higher damage (which will trigger knockdown on the enemy), however these can be dodged or armored through. This combo's DMG can range between the 100s if you only hit 1 alpha (Basic DMG) to the 300s (Medium DMG) if you hit all 3 alphas, doing more damage than the previous combo. This combo refers to the variation that does not use his Special Action.

</p>

### Special Action -> Beta 1 -> Alpha 
A variation of the previous combo if your BoomBox is on the field.

</p>

### (Special Action) -> Beta 1 -> Beta 1 
A combo that spends both beta charges to either save on gammas or defend yourself close range after spending all gamma charges escaping. It does more damage with the Special Action active.

</p>

### (Special Action) -> Gamma -> Alpha
An optimized follow up if you're using gamma without previously using beta, useful in close combat when you run out of beta charges. This combo's damage increases with DOWNd/KOd allies and/or the Special Action.
