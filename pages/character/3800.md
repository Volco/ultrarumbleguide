*The elusive magician puts on an enchanting show and pickpockets with precision.*

Mr. Compress is an expert in both offense and defense, being an excellent damage dealer and supporting teammates, as well as using his high mobility to sneak up on opponents or escape tense situations. Use his Alpha to burst down opponents, his Beta to block moves aimed at you or teammates, and his Gamma to chase, flee, loot, move allies or reposition. A character that loves sticking around areas with plenty of verticality where he can easily change his elevation and mask his location, but must be very wary of close-quarter brawls.

## Alpha Skill - Production Magic

<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress’ Alpha is his best move by far and his most reliable source of damage. It consists of 3 main components: the initial marble he throws, the object that comes out  and the shockwave once it lands.

### The Marble
The marble has a few unique properties. For starters, no matter the level of your Alpha, a direct hit with the marble will always deal 5 damage (although you will often see 75 instead because the 2nd part of his alpha will also hit), a fairly insignificant amount but it starts to pile up once it gets combined with the other parts of the Alpha. On top of this extra damage, hitting an opponent who has GP will cause them to be stunned in place, allowing you to follow up with more alphas as the opponent won't be able to move. This aspect of his Alpha turns Compress into a GP destroying machine, very hard to counteract once you’re stunned. 

The marble also travels in a different way from any other projectile currently in the game; after throwing the marble, instead of going straight forward like a generic projectile, it will actually travel on an arc. On top of that, if the marble hits a wall or the floor it will bounce off instead of dissapearing. It's very much worth noting however that both of these properties change when you enter Aim Mode: the arc/angle at which Compress throws the marble is much different, allowinging it to travel farther distances and slowing the spawning of the object inside the marble. Most importantly, because of both of these variations, in Aim Mode, bouncing the marble off of objects or a wall to hit enemies is much easier.

</p>

### The Object

These items include the barrel at levels 1-3, the boulder at 4-6, and the truck at 7-9, each being bigger than the previous (Trucks are especially excellent at hitting enemies standing too close to the edge of a corner, like doorways for example, thanks to this expanded size and hitbox). This part of the Alpha is the move that deals most of the damage when playing Compress. Do try to always keep one alpha in your pocket, as the penalty reload is much longer than the individual charges returning. What you will need to be careful with is his downpower when in combination with teammates. Opponents getting hit by multiple moves at once alongside Compress' alpha will be knocked down much quicker, meaning sometimes it may be better for you to throw fewer Alphas if your teammates can deal more damage with their own moves. This will also apply to opponents being hit by the moves of other opponents.

</p>

### The Shockwave

The shockwave from Compress’ alpha comes out from the released object when it hits the ground, with its size and damage being dictated by level just like with the object itself. There’s really nothing special about the shockwave, aside from the fact it expands the range at which you can hit enemies not currently in your line of sight.
Hitting all 3 parts of Compress' alpha is much easier when attacking from above, as normally at ground level the shockwave goes past the target you've hit with the marble, while if you hit them from above you can avoid this.

## Beta Skill - Sleight of Hand

</p>

Compress’ Beta Skill is a barrier that can stop projectiles from hurting him or allies.
When a projectile hits this barrier, Compress will quickly compress it and reflect it back, dealing some extra damage the original projectile didn't have. 

Different Moves can have 3 types of interactions with Compress' Beta: Reflect, Block and Ignore.

</p>

**Reflectable Moves**

Reflectable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress' shield will be sent back to the enemy, dealing increased damage. Usually, projectiles are reflectable, while melee attacks are usually not reflectable. Reflected moves are not guaranteed to hit the target, especially if they're moving quickly. For a list of reflectable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

</p>

**Blockable Moves**

Blockable moves are attacks that upon hitting Compress' shield will vanish, but won't be reflected back to the original user. While these won't do damage to the enemy, it will also cause no damage to you. For a list of blockable moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/MrB2.gif" width="400" />
</p>

**Ignored Moves**

Ignored moves are attacks that do not interact with Compress' shield, hence, they will ignore it and damage him. Moves in this category are often shockwaves, physical attacks, or area attacks that might also hit Compress from behind. For a list of ignored moves scroll at the bottom of Beta's section.

Beta is Compress’ most defensive tool, able to block all sorts of damage as you can see above. This has a variety of uses, the most obvious of which is to use it mid shoot off to reflect alphas at trigger happy opponents. Swapping back and forth between this and your alpha conserves your own health and can often force enemies into engaging with you close up so you can start Melee combos. This move is percentage based, meaning you can hold it up as much as you want, but the more hits it absorbes the more percentage gets consumed until it's forced into reload. A helpful tip is that this move can be rolled to avoid the EndLag of deactivating it.
However this isn't the only way to use your Beta; other uses consist of leaning into Compress’ Support role by protecting teammates from taking damage too. Stand in front of allies opening boxes, supply drops or even finishing enemies to stop your opponents from interrupting your team. Even standing in front of an ally while they have a shoot off will essentially make them invincible while the fight is happening. Beta is widely considered one of the worst moves in the game, so show everyone just how useful (or annoying) it can actually be.

## Gamma Skill - Magician's Choice
<p align="center">

</p>

Mr. Compress' Gamma is all about movement. With this move, he compresses himself into a marble and performs a high leap into the air, leaving a cloud of smoke behind. This Skill can be used to reposition, run away, chase enemies, gain height, dodge attacks, truly a jack of all trades when it comes to mobility. Not only that, but when levelling this skill to level 9 you will gain a second charge, giving it even more potential uses.

You need to be careful when you use it, as due to its slow recharge time being caught without it can sometimes be a death sentence or the reason an opponent escapes. For this reason using the Gamma offensively is for the most part a fairly unwise decision when playing Compress, especially early game before you have the levels for a quicker recharge. If you do use it offensively, it's best done when you already have the second charge you get with level 9 or when you can guarantee it will do damage, such as using it to end a combo. You could also use it to catch the wake up of people who mash and don’t use their i-frames, as the explosion at higher levels has a decent size and damage.
One of the main reasons this move is so good is because Compress gains Hyper Armor while doing the animation, allowing him to almost always at least enter his marble and drop his bomb on wake up catches or start his flight while running away. Some things to keep in mind are that Hyper Armor doesn't stop damage at all, it will just avoid getting knock downed, and that you do NOT have armor while in the marble itself and can be knocked out of it, essentially wasting your charge. Some moves can also hit through the move's armor and knock you down regardless.

## Special Action - Magic Resurrection
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch038.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Compress' Special Action lets him compress and pocket an ally at any time, as long as he is close to them. If the ally was alive when pocketed, they will stay in the pocket and regain health (HP) slowly (they can break out of the pocket at any time by pressing any attack button). If the ally was downed, Compress will still pick them up but they won't get healed over time, instead they'll get revived once uncompressed.

Now, the most clear and obvious use of this is to pick up a downed teammate in order to revive them, but this might not be the best idea in every situation. As weird as it might sound, sometimes you need to let your allies die. If, for example, a Strike Shigaraki and an All Might are both spamming Alpha on your downed teammate, not only will you probably not make it in time to save them, but you might also get killed yourself. Now this isn't to say never rescue your teammates, but just be aware of who’s around and what situation both you and your downed teammate are in before committing to the rescue. Additionally, if you do manage to pick up a downed teammate, keep in mind you don't always need to teleport away with Gamma; sometimes just walking behind cover is more than enough if the focus is elsewhere and so you don't leave your third teammate fighting alone while you're coming back from teleporting away. A lot of times picking someone up just to drop them immediately works, especially if they have their own mobility, as it means you can stay in the action to help your other teammate once more while they run and heal. This is especially good in final circles where you can’t guarantee there will even be anywhere safe to bring them if you try to Gamma away. A neat little trick you can actually do when you're the one being carried by Compress is pressing the Jump or Attack button once your time reaches zero to instantly revive yourself without needing to go through the uncompressing animation. Compress' Special Action isn't just useful for downed teammates, though.

Carrying non-downed teammates can be practical: being able to carry non-mobile teammates long distance or even high mobility ones to save them from wasting their own abilities. You can use this to enter fights, traverse buildings/terrain, or even help someone escape before they go down, all while slowly regaining HP. The main advantage of this is potential heal-offs in final circles. Although not a common way for games to end, if it comes down to it, Compress can put a teammate in his pocket to not only passively heal storm damage, but also prevent storm damage affecting them whatsoever, in most situations essentially guaranteeing a win. Using it in this way is better when you can communicate with your team directly so they know why you want to pick them up, but don’t hesitate to try it with randoms either if they cooperate.

## Basic Attacks
<br>**Ground Melee**</br>

A 2-string combo, Compress’ Ground Melee consists of 2 different hits before knocking down the opponent. With the first hit Compress will strike the enemy with his cane in a sideways motion. This is the part of Compress’ Melee you'll be using the most. For the second hit, he spins his cane in his hand hitting the opponent multiple times and causing them to be knocked down. It's used as a combo ender. Compress’ first Melee hit can be chained into itself a maximum of 5 times before knocking over an opponent. For this reason, it's best to hit 4 in a row and then knock over with the second hit for max damage. It's important to note that compared to many other Melees, Compress’s is actually quite slow due to him reeling back the cane before his first strike. This often means that in situations where you and the enemy both go for a Melee, Compress will often be the one getting hit and allowing your opponent to start potential combos. If you're not fast enough, it can also result in your Melee chains being broken via the enemy's melee (or roll).

</p>

**Air Melee**<br>

Compress' Air Melee is an uppercut with the cane, knocking opponents into the air. Used as a combo starter or tool to quickly knock back nearby opponents. 
Best used when dropping in from above, such as when falling from highground or from a Gamma teleport as the momentum allows you to combo into more Melees easier.

## Leveling Paths
### Standard Path
This is the best level up path on Mr. Compress. It's by far his best option and there really isn't any other that comes close to it. Getting your Alpha to level 7 is to get your item size to Trucks as fast as possible. This allows Compress to deal much more consistent damage with his bigger Alpha and rely less on aim than with his smaller projectiles. Because Compress struggles to deal consistent damage early on, this is the best way to support your team and yourself through early engagements. Gamma to 9 afterward is to make sure you have Compress’ best movement option available, as he doesn't get the second charge of his Gamma until level 9. This allows you to chase, run and move around much faster and over greater distances. Alpha to level 9 after is for the extra charge you get at the final level and for increased damage. Beta can wait until the end as the size and ammo increases it gets are rarely needed, and the increased reflection damage, while nice, should be secondary to your movement and primary source of damage. If you want you can delay leveling your Beta even longer and instead give level up cards to your team once your Alpha and Gamma are both maxed.

</p>

### Escape Path
This level up path can be used when you spawn in and absolutely nobody is around for you to fight. This would mean that you realistically shouldn't need to level up your Alpha right away, and can instead focus on your movement for faster looting. It can also be used when you are having a particularly bad time looting, such as suffering an early death, to just simply get your movement online to ensure you don’t go down again. While this has the potential to be an okay alternative to the main path, you don’t particularly need 2 Gammas to loot fast on Compress, and in the event a team does rotate to your general location, having your level 7 Alpha is just so good for consistency. This could work for players who can already confidently hit Alphas regardless of size, and don’t necessarily need the extra size provided by the truck projectile. This path could also work for a more supportive style of play on Compress, allowing you to both get to civilians faster, and quickly move in and out of fights to use team heals when your allies find themselves in a bad spot. Alternatively, you could also use this in unranked games to practice your aim with lower level versions of the Alpha. Beta is levelled last for the same reason as before.

### Escape Path: Cautious Ver.
A variation of the previous path in which you level Alpha to 4 as a precautionary measure just in case people end up coming to your area regardless.

## Techs
Mr. Compress has 3 special behaviors that you can learn to enhance your gameplay.
### Air Extension
After using gamma, you can spam the melee button to perform air melees. This will allow you to fall a bit slower, allowing you to traverse a greater distance or stall in the air for a longer amount of time.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee Cancelling
By inputting a melee attack while not holding a direction, waiting until the last moment to use his melee's second hit and then inputting a direction (backwards is best) you can cancel the animation of his cane spinning and start moving again immediately. This can be fully chained a total of 3 times, before knocking down the enemy on the fourth hit of your first melee, meaning ideally you want to let the cane spin finish after the third chain. This can also be done with Compress’ air melee by waiting until you’ve almost touched the ground, using air melee, and then quickly inputting it again, allowing for up to 2 extra air melees to come out. Unfortunately hitting the first 2 will hard knockdown an opponent, rendering the potential third useless.<br>
<br>
The input would be: Melee 1 (No Direction Key pressed) -> Wait (The delay you gotta wait might make you hit a 2nd Melee 1, but this is bad, you gotta wait a decent bit but not enough to trigger a 2nd Melee 1 instead of a Melee 2) -> Melee 2 -> Movement Key (preferrably back, with tiny delay to avoid cancelling Melee 2 too soon)

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma Cancelling
This tech allows Mr. Compress to exit his Gamma early in some situations. By standing a small distance away from a ledge, and aiming down to about your waist level, Compress will exit his marble and briefly perform the start of the exit animation midair while also losing all of his momentum. This likely happens as the game sees Compress’ marble nearly hitting the ledge as him landing, and as such it boots you out prematurely. The biggest problem with this tech is that it is scarcely, if ever, actually a useful thing to perform. It's quite hard to imagine a situation where it isn’t much more time and cost effective to simply jump or even run off of whatever building you're on rather than wasting a charge of your Gamma. In very niche situations it may confuse chasing opponents who expect you to teleport far away thanks to the smoke cloud hiding you, but if you're caught you've very likely screwed yourself. If this is ever changed to possibly not remove Compress’ momentum it may become more niche, but until that day you’re likely better off avoiding it.

## Combos
The different ways you can combine and chain various skills for higher damage within 500 DP (Downpower). The downpower of Mr. Compress' abilities are as follows:<br>
<br>
Alpha Skill: ? DP (Marble), 100 DP (Object), 100 DP (Shockwave)<br>
Beta Skill: - DP<br>
Gamma Skill: 10 DP<br>
Ground Melee: 100 DP (Melee 1), 300 DP (Melee 2), 400 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
<br>
The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are, in this case, we will define as "True" combos that, without 3rd party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as those are special cases.<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

### Air Melee -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A basic combo that most characters have, using Air Melee as combo starter and chain it into a ground melee chain.
<p align="center">

</p>

### Melee 1 -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Melee 1**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Melee 1**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Melee 1**</a> -> Melee 2
A classic Melee 1 spam chain that keeps the enemy locked in place for a while. This combo only works on HP, as Compress' melee is too slow for GP stun's quick recovery.
<p align="center">

</p>

###Air Melee -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
Using Air Melee you can get close quarters opponents off of you, and the stun from your Alpha keeps them stuck in midair as long as they have GP.

</p>

###Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Jump -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> Air Melee -> Alpha
What this combo lacks in optimization it makes up for in flashiness. Typically not the ideal combo to hit, but it does look nice while dealing decent damage.
<p align="center">

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A more complex melee chain that makes use of Melee 2 Cancel for combo extension.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c3-gif.gif" width="400" />
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/light+-dmg.png" width="400" />
</p>

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a>
A good combo to hit on anyone whos gotten a little too close. You need to ADS for at least the first Alpha, as otherwise enemies will be knocked in the wrong direction due to the Melee Cancel.

Mr. Compress' signature combo that everyone knows. It takes advantage of the marble's stun property on enemies with GP to deliver free damage. This combo doesn't work on HP.

</p>

### Air Melee -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Gamma
Uses Air Melee to knock opponents into the air and then Alpha to close distance for you to melee. The Gamma end is more damaging, but takes up a valuable charge for the skill.
<p align="center">

### <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2
A variation of his regular alpha chain. While it's less damaging then the 5 Alphas, it makes finishing the combo easier if you're up close, and lets you activate any melee reliant Special Tunings.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/3800c12-gif.gif" width="400" />

### <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Gamma
An improvement on the previous combo, the Gamma end is once again more damaging but will use up a charge. It's one of Compress’ more damaging combos.

### Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Alpha**</a> -> Melee 1 -> Melee 2 Cancel -> Gamma
A variation of the previous combo. Slightly more damaging, at the cost of being more difficult to perform. You’ll need to use Aim Mode to correct your aim for at least the first Alpha. Due to this combos length, you may need to cut it short outside of 1v1 situations.

The general recommended priority list by stats is as follows: **Alpha DMG > HP DMG > GP DMG > HP DEF > Gamma Reload > Alpha Reload >  Melee DMG > Beta DEF > Gamma DEF > PU/PC Reload > Gamma DMG > Alpha DEF > Melee DEF > GP+ > HP+ > Beta Reload > Downed HP > Vert. Jump Height+ > Forw. Jump Height+ > Wall Jump Height+ > Dash Speed+ > Run Speed+ > Wall Shuffle Speed+ > Downed Crawl Speed+ > Special Action Reload**

When it comes to the minor Tunings slots you want to run on Compress there are two clear best options. Alpha damage is key, as it's his best attacking skill and where the vast majority of your damage will come from. Getting this as high as possible on your preferred costume is ideal. His next best will be Gamma reload, as Compress heavily relies on the movement from this skill to maneuver around the map, making attacking, running and looting much easier. Alpha reload is good too due to how reliant you are on your Alpha for damage. This means getting it back quicker should also be a priority. HP and GP damage are great for increasing your Alphas damage potential even more, and HP defense helps reduce all incoming damage once your GP is broken. 

After this we start getting a little more niche, with melee damage helping you fend off enemies in close-quarters a bit better, and Beta and Gamma defense to mitigate some of the game's higher damaging skills. PU/PC reload can come in clutch to help you get that last percent of Plus Chaos in before you die, and rewards you for surviving longer. Gamma damage, while not great, can help when you do use it for offense or if an enemy happens to get a little too close to your smoke bomb while you flee. Alpha and melee defense are alright to have, but ideally you shouldn’t go out of your way to get them unless they’re the secondary effect accompanying something better like Alpha damage. GP+ and HP+ while appreciated, are always gonna be worse than the defense increasing tunes, so ideally try to run the ones with secondary effects to make up for this. 

After that, most of the following tunes will be pretty useless. Beta reload isn’t needed almost ever, as even at low levels you’ll struggle to run out of charge for this ability. Downed HP, while it sounds okay, only benefits you once you’ve already lost, something that theoretically could have been prevented by running a better defensive Tuning option. When it comes to the jump heights all the boosts they provide are so inconsequential you’ll never want to run those Tunings specifically for that boost. The same applies to the speed increasing Tunes. If you run these, choose the ones with better secondary boosts, like Gamma and Alpha reload, or Melee damage. Finally, the single worst tune on Compress is Special Action reload, as he doesn’t benefit from it at all. The reload on his Special Action is so quick that there is truly no point in using this Tuning, unless it comes with a better secondary Tuning.

### Special Tunes
The list of recommended special tunes (not ordered):
|    |  |
|----|--|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>With how easily Compress is able to break GP, activating this Tuning shouldn’t be an issue. The increased speed at which you get both your Gammas and Alphas back will make fighting, running, and chasing much easier to do consistently. Essentially this functions as a better ‘Revenge Tech,’ as you don’t need to lose GP to get the same benefit.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Gives Compress highground for free without the need to use his Gamma. Also gives you an additional option on wake up by jumping before you Gamma. Makes spamming Alphas from above even easier, and makes landing the shockwave more reliable. Gets you above certain moves that are otherwise problematic. |
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br>Makes you invincible every time your GP breaks, stopping combos or giving you an opportunity to disengage. At higher levels you can use a small GP or HP drink to heal before permeation ends, or if you aren’t knocked over a large GP drink if you time it well. Attacking will end the permeation early.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch202_00.png" width="125"> | **Acceleration** <br>Getting a movement speed boost for landing a melee is incredible with the movement system changes. Allows your Gamma to become even better for movement, and makes your Alpha, Gamma, and melee come out quicker than before, making Compress much more threatening.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Gives you an opportunity to escape or keep fighting when you would have otherwise gone DOWN. It almost functions like a second life.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_02.png" width="125"> | **Hyper Regeneration** <br>An excellent survivability TUNING for Compress due to how easily he can break GP. Allows you to play more aggressively without needing to constantly use smaller heals, and is great for letting you reset yourself and survive within the Poison Mist.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Functions similarly to the ‘Revenge’ Special Tunings all wrapped into one. It will be reliant on what Quirk Skill cards you can find however, and what level they’re at for it to function at its highest potential. Best used with Tech cards, but is good with the others as well.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>Great for increasing your Alpha damage even more. Great when used in tandem with other attack increasing Tuning like Embrittlement or Revenge Strike to make your damage potential even higher. Works best on outfits like Disguise: Sweater (Dangerous) and Cyberpunk (Dangerous).|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"> | **Divine Protection** <br>Very useful since Compress is a level dependent character. He can get in and out of areas with a large box quickly thanks to his Gamma. Also gets you a full team heal and a revive card for support play. Not advised to drop on the large box at the start of a game, even with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch015_01.png" width="125"> | **Embrittlement** <br>Since a lot of Compress’s combos utilize his melee, Embrittlement is quite good on him. Also makes any attacks made during or after a melee hit much more deadly. Makes you more threatening in close range since enemies must be weary of the Defense DOWN you can inflict.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch002_00.png" width="125"> | **Crushing PU Charge** <br>A strong option on Compress thanks to his high damage output and fairly easy time confirming kills. The 20% of PU/PC this provides can be very good, especially when paired with other PU/PC reliant tunes, namely ‘Muscle Form.’ Do keep in mind you’ll be sacrificing an Alpha DMG increase to run this however.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch012_01.png" width="125"> | **Muscle Form** <br>The HP provided on Plus Chaos allows you to delay using it until you know for sure you can’t get away. More importantly though, this provides you with extra armor upon using Plus Chaos, making it almost impossible to stop Compress’ Gamma with anything other than a grab attack, and lets Compress tank and walk through many problematic moves to get to safety.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch043_00.png" width="125"> | **Perception** <br>Highlighting enemies you melee is incredible for making sure they don't get away by weaving in and out of buildings or around obstacles. Compress already has a fantastic chase game, and Perception makes it even harder to escape him.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>Gives you an increase in reload speed every time your GP breaks. Allows you to get your Gamma back much quicker so you can run from or chase enemies more effectively. Combine with Plus Chaos for super fast reload speeds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Card Duplication** <br>Only advisable if you're comfortable fighting early. Typically it will still be better to get Alpha to level 7 and then use this to get Gamma to level 9 faster. Since Compress is level dependent, getting additional cards can help him a lot in the early-mid game. You can also siphon any additional cards gotten to your teammates.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch034_00.png" width="125"> | **Reinforced Revive** <br>Compress can make decent use of this thanks to having an instant revive. Having to pick up your downed ally does make it harder to use though since you put yourself in harm's way to grab a teammate. Assess the situation before getting too greedy with this Tuning.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch115_00.png" width="125"> | **Quick Reload** <br> Allows for an absurd amount of Alpha spam after downing an opponent. Makes finishing kills incredibly easy as well. Generally outclassed by Quirk Factor Release, but it is the best Strike (Villain) option as of right now.|

            <p>This outfit is good for increasing your reload speeds, keeping the downtime between your ability uses to
                a minimum. While it is lacking in Strike slots for extra damage, its Special Tuning more than makes up
                for that. Pairing Acceleration with Space Hop will make you a much harder target to hit and let you move
                around more freely, while options like Muscle Form or Card Dupe work as good alternatives.

            <p>This outfit provides you with some very high damage potential, being able to run all currently available
                Alpha DMG tunes with Strike slots to spare for HP or GP damage. Offers survivability and reload speed
                ups with its other slots. While its Assault Special Tuning slot is great for Space Hop, Embrittlement,
                or Quirk Factor Release, its Tech slot being limited to villains is lackluster. Revenge Tech is the best
                option unless you use Quirk Factor Release, in which case you’ll want to use HP Sucker.

            <p>A great option for high Alpha damage builds, it trades a bit of defense potential for better reload
                speeds. For Special Tuning you could run Divine Protection to reliably get levels and support items, or
                Reinforced Revive for a support oriented style of play. For extra survivability you could also run
                Revenge Support. Embrittlement is great for even higher damage on this build, but Quirk Factor release
                is an excellent option as well.

            <p>Another costume with good defense thanks to the plenty of Assault slots it has. It also has the two
                Strike slots it needs for Alpha damage as well. The only downside to this costume is the one Tech slot,
                limiting your reload speeds, but this could be easily mitigated by running Quirk Factor Release. Just
                like before, Space Hop and Embrittlement are great alternatives though. Willpower is good for the Strike
                side, or Ability Manifest as another way to make up for the lack of reload speed.

            <p>Utilizing Fixer alongside either Iron Fist or Revenge Strike, this outfit grants Compress some of his
                highest possible Alpha damage. Offers a lot of reload speed increases, and a bit of defense as well.
                Willpower or Ability Manifest are good Strike slot alternatives, and Crit Perm or High Speed
                Replenishment could work for the Tech slot too.

            <p>While this costume is a little held back by only having one Strike and Tech slot, its Special Tuning more
                than makes up for this. Being able to run any combination of Quirk Factor Release, Space Hop, and
                Embrittlement together still make this one of Compress’ better costumes. Embrittlement can make up for
                the lack of damage, but Quirk Factor Release and Space Hop are both very good too and should absolutely
                be considered to be run together.

            <p>An outfit with very high reload speeds, this costume is great for allowing Compress to move in and out of
                fights more quickly. While it does lack Strike slots, it can still increase its damage in other slots to
                make up for some of what's lost. While Divine Protection is a good option for the Support Special
                Tuning, Reinforced Revive can also be good here thanks to how quick Compress can get in and out with the
                increased reload speed. Make getting in and out even easier by running Acceleration in the Rapid slot.

            <p>This costume is very well balanced across its normal Tuning slots, having decent damage, reload speeds
                and defense across the board, but nothing too crazy. Its tech slot is perfect for running Critical
                Permeation, as Fixer doesn’t get as much use on this costume. Revenge Tech is a decent option as well.
                The Assault slot will work best with Space Hop to keep you mobile without needing to use your Gamma.

            <p>A great budget costume for Compress. Has good damage potential with Strike slots, good reload increases
                with the Rapid/Tech slots, and good survival with the Assault/Support slots. You can run any option of
                Fixer, Critical Permeation, HP Sucker or Revenge Technical, but keep in mind their effects won’t be as
                strong. Embrittlement in the Assault slot gives you extra damage, or Quirk Factor Releaes to help with
                your reload.

                Critical Permeation, HP Sucker or Revenge Technical, with GP Sucker or Card Duplication on the right.
                Due to the TUNING not being a high level you will need to fight quite early if you hope to get use from

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Deku’s reliance on his Alpha for damage is great news for Compress, as his Beta reflects it back for big damage on trigger happy opponents. If you hold your Beta out the most common counter will be to close distance and knock you out of it with his Beta, so watch for this response. His Gamma can be blocked, and if he uses it for movement, Compress can pretty easily catch up once he has both Gammas himself. His melee is unfortunately quite fast however, meaning he can easily break out of melee chains done on GP. Watch for the Beta and his Gamma grab combo, and this matchup favours Compress.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Unlike regular Deku, Compress can struggle a good bit against Full Bullet. If he gets the jump on you he’ll likely be able to knock you down with his Alpha before you can put Beta up to reflect it. Having to play wake-up isn't great when on Compress, as your only real option in these disadvantageous scenarios is to use his i-frames to get distance and then Gamma away. To make matters worse, Full Bullet can catch you in the marble with the heel grab of his Beta, or if you take too long to teleport, can simply knock you over again with his Alpha and restart the cycle. If you do manage to reflect his Alpha, he will take a lot of damage in return however, and may hard knockdown himself. You can also try to Gamma into the air while he's falling with his Beta, as you may be able to land some Alphas as he tries to recover.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Deku’s continued mastery of One For All is making him harder and harder to compete against when on Compress. While his grounded Alpha is easy to reflect thanks to its long wind-up, and his aerial Alpha is fairly easy to stop too, that's about where the positives end for Compress. OFA Deku is highly mobile and has great tools to get in and pressure you in close range. His melee armor will prevent you from stunning him yourself, so you really have no way to prevent him from going into Overdrive. Once in Overdrive his movement and close range expertise will become even more oppressive. In a one on one, the only opportunities you’ll have to punish OFA Deku is when he first activates either his Gamma, or his Special Action Fa Jin. If he activates his Special Action Smoke Screen prior to this however, it’ll be very hard to punish him with your Alphas stun. Alternatively, if you’re in a bigger fight look to wail on him while he’s performing melee’s on another player, as he’ll be stuck for a brief window finishing the animation. While you do have good movement to get away from this engagement, OFA Deku can do a decent job of catching up to you, or could even use the tracking on his Gamma to knock you out of the sky. If possible, it's best to try and use Gamma from behind cover to mitigate the chance he locks on to you.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Bakugo is another character who heavily relies on his easily reflectable Alpha. However in this match-up you can also reflect the grenades that Bakugo throws as well, and even block the splash damage from grenades that hit the ground. Bakugo can counter this by throwing grenades behind you to get past your Beta and hit your back, but otherwise half of his kit is almost completely countered here. He also lacks combos to make up for this, meaning he loses a lot of damage output in this fight. On top of this his mobility is quite poor compared to Compress, meaning chase or escape is easy too. As long as you dodge his incredibly telegraphed Gamma, this match-up is a breeze in most situations. 
<br>

## Katsugi Bakugo (Machine Gun) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch002var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Machine Gun loves to get in close and move around fast with non-linear movement. He excels at getting in your face and making marbles hard to hit, so stunning him is often out of the question without incredible aim. While your Beta can reflect his Alpha and even block his Beta, it can often be difficult to know when to use it due to Machine Guns sporadic movement. His Beta can still hit you from above or behind as well. To fight this character you must often predict where he’s going to go in order to properly hit him, which isn't always easy, especially when he's going after you or has teammates close by. Try to get the jump on him first and force a chase so he’s using his abilities to run instead of fight back.

## Ochaco Uraraka (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch003/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch003_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Your Beta is very important in this match up. Compress can block Ochaco’s Alpha, stopping damage and ruining her momentum if she’s airborne. Additionally, if she throws her Beta you can reflect it to stun her and potentially start your own combo. The obvious downside of this match up is if she hits her Gamma on you, it's a near death combo that forces you into a wake-up catch situation. It can also lift you up out of your own Gamma. If she picks you up with her Gamma, Beta as soon as possible to try and block her Beta and Alpha. If she goes for her Beta to try and wake up catch you, you may be able to reflect it if she throws immediately, stunning her and buying time to get away with your Gamma. Her movement with Zero Gravity, while typically better than Compress’, does leave her open while activating it, and without it she may struggle to run or catch up. 
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Reflect her Alphas when at range for high damage, and dodge it when she charges it up in close range engagements. Her Beta, while good mobility, is worse than Compress’ and is easy to track due to its size. Her Gamma is once again the biggest issue, as getting caught in it means taking a lot of damage. Just like rapid Ochaco, this Gamma can also catch your teleport if you aren't careful. Her mobility is okay, but its unlikely she'll be able to catch up to Compress anytime outside of the final circles. Lots of Zero Satellite players will try to use her charged Gamma to create a safe spot to heal, but this is very easy for Compress to counter thanks to his great verticality when using his Gamma. Teleporting up to rain Alphas on her works wonders here, and forces her to run away, delaying her healing once more. You can even claim her island for yourself if needed. 
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Iida is one of Compress’ worst match ups. He excels in getting in your face and staying there, delivering high damage combos if you make just one mistake. His incredible movement makes him a nightmare to hit, especially the directs you need to stun him. None of his moves can be reflected or blocked, and his Gamma makes running away or chasing him quite difficult. His Air Melee adds another element to his movement and makes him even harder to predict when in the air. To punish him, dodge either his Alpha or his Beta, spin around and try to stun him with your Alpha to start your own combo. If he has no GP and can’t be stunned, he becomes incredibly hard to punish unless he messes up very badly. Getting the jump on him is your best bet, as his low base health means you can deal a lot of damage when he doesn’t see you coming.<br>

## Shoto Todoroki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch004/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch004_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Another spammy character, Shoto loves shooting Alphas you can reflect. When a Shoto notices you start reflecting, the most common response is to use Gamma to try and freeze you so you can no longer fight back. Be ready to roll, and keep up the pressure with your own Alpha. Try your best to stay in a mid range when fighting Shoto, as getting close allows him to use his Beta on you for big damage or easily freeze you with Gamma. His mobility is much worse than Compress’ and you should be able to catch up or run easily. If he hides inside a building and blocks the door with his Beta, try to Gamma to another entrance to catch him off guard. If he uses Beta to create cover in the open, teleport over and rain Alphas on him or hold Beta to stop him from shooting you through the wall.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ice Fang is another good match-up for Compress, as long as you keep that nice midrange distance. Since his Alphas can freeze up close, and his Beta and Gamma both excel in that range, it's very important to not get too close. Just like with strike Shoto, reflecting his Alpha will likely trigger Ice Fang to go for his Beta spike. This is harder to dodge, so be especially careful here. The explosion after is more telegraphed fortunately, and not as hard to dodge, especially if you use your i-frames. The explosion can knock you out of your marble when using Gamma if you aren't careful. If you get Ice Fang low or start a shoot off, they’ll likely use Gamma to block your shots, which you can either teleport over, or absorb with your Beta to remove his cover. He has no mobility, so he can’t chase or escape easily.
<br>

## Tsuyu Asui <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch006/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch006_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Tsuyu’s main combo involves her getting close using her Alpha, and then going into Beta you. Blocking her Alpha will stop her momentum, and leave her open to a counter attack while she's stuck in the air. If she tries to Beta you dodge her aerial one by rolling to the side. The grounded Beta is a bit harder, but you’ll see most success rolling away from her rather than behind her, as the tongues hitbox will still reach back there if you mistime it. If she misses her ground Beta, she's left wide open, allowing for an easy punish. Her mobility lets her move similar distances to Compress, but while slightly more versatile in where she moves it's also slower, giving neither a clear advantage there. Watch for the extra movement granted by her air melee however, as it allows her to weave around you more easily in close quarters. If she's in your face, dodge her Betas, and then Gamma away.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Despite his terrible mobility, Kirishima actually doesn’t fare too badly against Compress in other departments. For starters none of his attacks can be reflected or blocked by Compress’ Beta, making the move useless in this fight. Additionally Kirishima is one of the kings of wake up catches, with his two most powerful moves knocking you down on hit and being great at catching you too. Compress hates being put in these kinds of situations as he has very limited options on what can be done on wake up. The worst part of this match up for Compress however is actually Kirishima's Special Action. Hardening completely removes the stun from Compress’ Alpha, one of his best tools, and also cuts the damage by a large amount. The only reason Compress doesn't lose this match up is purely because of Kirishima’s terrible movement. In areas with buildings/high ground, Compress' best option is to try and stay above Kiri and use his Alpha to scare him away, or force him to eat damage on his approach, before running and repeating over and over. If Kirishima had movement, he’d be an absolute nightmare for Compress.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Compress’ greatest nightmare, Red Drive takes all the good things about Assault Kirishima and gives it movement. This is likely Compress’ worst match up. Everything said about Kirishima’s Special Action before is true once more, except now he is also much harder to hit. Red Drive’s Special Action basically makes him unpunishable in the Compress match up. Alongside that, his combo game and damage potential are insane, easily out performing Compress. It’s even harder to benefit from catching Red Drive off guard due to his much larger health pool, and Special Action meaning you may not even be stunning him when you do get the drop. The only redeeming factor of this match up is that Compress can reflect Red Drive’s Gamma, which is actually a very big deal here. Red Drive players love to spam this when you’re out of range or in the air, so this gives you an opportunity to deal high damage back from relative safety since you can easily be hit if you try to spam your Alpha while up high. It's best to try to stay above him using your Alpha in moderation and reflecting his Gamma when he tries to hit you back. While his movement is excellent, Compress can make ground initially when it comes to getting away. Even if he can catch up fairly well, it at least gives Compress a chance to run.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress can easily reflect Kaminari’s Alpha shots, and keep up with him due to his lesser mobility. His Beta will leave him stationary, so use this to your advantage if he ever misses it to deal huge damage to him. If you're ever caught inside, try and back up while spamming Alphas at him now that he can't move. The thing that evens out this match-up is just how high the damage is when Kaminari lands his Gamma on you. While telegraphed, it still comes out decently fast, and if you're hit you’ll take huge damage, or maybe even go down if the Kaminari is with a coordinated team. His Special Action also makes landing melee combos on him impossible without being countered, severely limiting your methods of damage outside of using your Alpha, or reflecting his.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Compress’ Beta will block Lightning’s mines, as well as reflect his Alpha while he isn’t ADS. This highly limits Lighting's options in close range engagements, meaning his best bet is likely to try and Gamma you for a stun. Reflecting his Alpha can actually stun him in return if he tries spamming it without thinking, setting you up for some free hits. You’ll also need to be weary of his Special Action preventing your melee combos too. When it comes to Lightning’s homing (aim mode) Alpha, you unfortunately block it rather than reflect, but this is good enough to keep you safe while you’re in his range. Your Gamma is great for closing ground so you can confront these players as well. If you ever have to escape from a Lightning Denki using your Gamma, remember to activate Beta in the air the second you exit your marble to prevent them from hitting you with their homing Alpha as you run.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
A good match up for Compress, he out performs Momo in most situations. Her lack of movement and consistent ranged damage is very noticeable here, as she essentially can't do anything to you in even a midrange engagement, and even less if you're above her. Her Beta, while it does block your shots, is very simple to dodge, and can also be teleported over to rain Alphas from above. If she uses it to run you can hit her from behind or Gamma to catch up. While her Gamma is strong, it isn’t great outside and the cannonballs can also be reflected by your Beta if needed. Your Beta also blocks its splash damage. Her Alpha is likely her best option here, as it easily knocks down and allows for wake up catching with her Gamma. It can be reflected however, so predict when she uses it and you’ll stun her to start your own combo. The only place she can turn tides is inside where her close range expertise can excel, especially her cannons. For the most part, just don’t follow her inside because that's where she wants to be.

## Neito Monoma <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch104_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟣Unknown🟣<br>
While this match up is often decided by what quirks Monoma is currently in possession of, he does have something else he can take advantage of. Obviously his Special Action refreshing is what beings referred to here, giving him some incredible movement with his Beta and stolen quirks. In early to midgame, Monoma is near impossible to catch up thanks to this refresh unless he gets very cocky and doesn’t get far enough away. If his Special Action depletes or he doesn't go far enough, Compress’ double Gamma is good movement against him. If he’s able to copy your Gamma it makes his mobility even scarier. His refresh also allows Monoma to spam a variety of other moves, many of which Compress could possibly struggle with. In terms of his base kit his Alpha can be reflected for surprisingly high damage thanks to its high fire rate, or leaves him pretty exposed to a stun from your own Alpha. His beta is the biggest issue just because it's a fast melee attack, but it fortunately isn't too threatening. If he enters his Gamma its best not to hit him so he doesn't get given yours. If he starts healing with it active, you’ll need to weigh your options to determine if it's worth stopping him at the price of giving your Gamma. Typically it won't be unless your sure you can secure the kill immediately afterward. When it comes to Monoma's who air stall, Compress does actually do quite well against them. Your double Gamma allows you to get incredibly high in the air, and even if he’s still above you your Alphas range can still allow you to hit him. Grab a teammate with your Special Action and bring them up there too to try and force him down even faster.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Kendo’s shield is a huge problem for Compress in a fight. Its huge size and high health means in a one on one situation, there's really no way to hit Kendo until you can wear down her shields health. To make matters worse, if the item from Compress’ Alpha isn't released before hitting the shield, it will only take the 5 damage the marble hits for instead of the much larger damage done by the item and shockwave. Kendo is another character who loves wake up catching too, and her Gamma is excellent for this. Her Alpha also does big damage while in close range, and while you can reflect it for big damage back she may bait you into this before hitting you with Gamma. Her melee combo game is also very good, and much better than Compress’, so be careful there too. Try to just keep her at a distance to whittle down her shield and run with your Gamma if she gets close. Fortunately she doesn't have the movement to chase or run from Compress, so without her shield she’s a sitting duck.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Unfortunately Kendo has been given movement to chase and run from Compress, turning an already bad match up into a terrible one. While Compress’ double Gamma is still better overall for distance, Twin Palm’s Gamma into air melee movement is incredible and she can definitely still catch up if you aren’t careful, especially early game or in smaller final circles. Her Alpha will stun you too (even through Gammas armor) and although you can reflect it to stun her and use Gamma to get away or start your own combo, you're bound to take high damage if you’re hit. Her Beta allows her to soak up damage while increasing its power, and like Kirishima prevents your Alpha from stunning her, nullifying Compress’ greatest strength. All of her moves can easily force wake up catches too. If she tries to catch you with a charged Alpha or while you're in the air, hold Beta and force her to miss her Alpha or take the reflected hit so you can Gamma. If she keeps holding it, move to cover or break line of sight to try getting away with Gamma. If she doesn't charge the Alpha she could pretty much try anything, so it's best to just try and dodge what she chooses. Trying to reflect an uncharged Alpha is not worth taking a Beta or Gamma if you predict wrong.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Ibara can be a very scary fight when on Compress. With her Alpha she has huge range and even bigger damage, putting Compress at the disadvantage as he can’t block it with his Beta and it knocks him down. Her Beta, especially at higher levels, is great at both knocking you down and catching your wake up if you aren't careful. Her Gamma does insane damage directly to your HP, and like all grabs can hit you through your Gamma’s armor and stop it going off. Her close range expertise means you rarely want to try and melee her, especially since she has armor on all of her moves. All of her moves do leave her as a stationary target on a whiff, so make sure to capitalize on that to return big damage or get distance from her if you're in her Beta/Gamma range. The sky and tall buildings are unsurprisingly your best bet in this fight, as she's limited to using only her Alpha and being an easy target to hit if she misses while you look down on her. If you're in the air and she hits you however, you become a lot easier to hit again as your recovery takes away a lot of your momentum, making you a slow moving target in the open air. Make sure to utilize your i-frames so you aren't an easy target for a second hit.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While Mirio is prone to exploding if you can catch him off guard, his movement and love for close up encounters can sometimes put Compress at the disadvantage. He loves close quarters fights, and his movement is also superb, being one of very few characters who can outright get away from Compress. His Gamma being able to block your projectiles and force you in close can be good to bait you into an uncomfortable position. What helps Compress the most in this match up is Mirio’s low health pool, and easily exploitable punish windows upon an Alpha or Beta whiff. These leave Mirio stationary and if you're fast enough to hit him can lead to him taking big damage. If you aren't quick enough however, he can reset the situation if he enters his Special Action for invincibility to wait out his cooldowns. In his Special Action he can also just run up to you directly without threat to force close range fights. In this situation it's best to either run yourself, or use Gamma to get away.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Fitting his namesake, Sheer Counter is an excellent counter to just about everything Compress wants to do. For starters his Alpha makes him invincible, meaning not only can you not hit him with your own Alphas, but reflected Alphas don’t hit him back either unless he stands still. This is terrible for Compress, as your main method of damage is completely stopped here, and you can’t stun him either. His counter is also a fantastic move against Compress. Since your offensive gameplan pretty much boils down to spam Alpha, it's very easy for Sheer Counter to predict this and time his Gamma accordingly. Your Alphas huge size and the shockwave after make it especially easy for him to counter you. While his movement isn’t superb compared to Compress’, he actually has a way to counter your Gamma too. By timing his Gamma alongside yours, hitting him with the smoke bomb you drop will send him straight after you to easily knock you back down. You must play cautiously around Sheer Counter, baiting his counter so you can punish him on a whiff or run away. His Beta can be similarly punished if he misses, and fortunately isn’t too strong of a move. His Special Action is still a problem letting him engage you for free, except you now have to be careful about timing his counter if you try and Gamma away from him while he’s in it.

Although his Alpha is blocked by your Beta, the grab version of it can still be quite scary as a hit means you’re likely to be losing a large chunk of your health. That being said, a whiff or hit into your Beta often lets you squeeze an Alpha hit back at him while he recovers, giving you the sustainability to win the fight. His Beta is a bit trickier, as its tracking and movement speed can sometimes make it a bit awkward to dodge. On hit it also gives him invisibility, so make sure you keep track of him if he knocks you down. Learning the dodge window for this move makes it much more bearable since it's his best option against Compress. His Gamma is fortunately not a huge problem for Compress. While it will always be annoying as a third party tool, in a direct fight Compress can just block it with his Beta. If you catch a Tamaki using it with their back turned or if they miss, they’re a sitting duck and you can often deal huge damage or even downright knock them if they don’t cancel it fast enough.

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
One of Compress’ better match ups, Nejire is one of only four characters whose entire moveset can be stopped by Compress’ Beta. Her Alpha is quite damaging, but if she isn't careful you can reflect it back for huge damage, meaning she has to be careful when using it. Her Beta can be blocked with yours, and while it is good for knocking you down it takes quite a while to do so meaning you can easily put your Beta up to stop it. You can allow her to waste her Beta charge firing into your own Beta and then Alpha her back if she shifts focus. If she isn't looking at you her Beta leaves her a mostly stationary target to wail on too. Her Gamma can give her height making her harder to hit, but once more can be reflected, although it rarely actually hits her back. It is her best wake up catch in this match up, and it can still be threatening if she has her team with her to stop your Beta going up. Her movement is generally worse than Compress’ and while her floating and air dash can make it more difficult to hit her, you can just wait for her to come down since she can’t do anything to you up there anyway thanks to your Beta.

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While his Alpha can be blocked, often allowing you to slip in an Alpha while he recovers, his sheer damage potential and team combo potential still make this match up quite hard. Shinso is another character who thrives in catching your wake up with his Gamma and Beta. Teleporting into the air while he falls with his Beta is a great way to both take loads of damage and get knocked out of your marble, wasting a charge. This combined with the fact that the brief animation before you teleport leaves you wide open to being hit by his Gamma, Alpha, or even his Special Action, means your best wake up option is incredibly risky if you can't find a safe spot to use it. His Gamma allows him to land all his moves much easier if it connects, and it can even be mixed into combos for a guaranteed hit to make running even harder. On a miss however, he does leave himself quite open while he recovers which will allow you to spam Alphas in return. This also applies to his Special Action, and his Alpha as mentioned before. His movement is good but doesn't bring him quite as far as Compress' Gammas, and he's using up his best offensive skill to get around, so if you need to get away or you have to chase him neither option should be too difficult provided you can get going.

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
While All Might’s Alpha can be reflected like most others, you may be surprised to learn you can even block the splash damage from it with your Beta as well. All Might's Beta will be his best tool against you on Compress, as if you don’t recover quick enough after being hit, it can be combo’d into a second Beta or into a ton of Alphas. For this reason if you're hit by it, recover as fast as possible, but let your i-frames run out so you can’t be hit by any subsequent moves, especially that second Beta. If you start reflecting Alphas, this is most likely the move he’ll use in response, so get ready to dodge it. All Might's Gamma isn't too strong, and is mostly used as a way to stall since you can’t hit him while he’s in it. Typically All Might players will use his Special Action leap after exiting this to run, so be ready to quickly wail on him with Alphas while he crouches and then keep chase with your Gamma. This should fortunately be quite easy, as although All Might has decent movement Compress’ is still superior. If he chooses to use his Betas to get more distance it also means his best move in this fight will be gone, so keep track of how many charges he uses when moving around.

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatlings Alpha is just about one of the easiest Beta reflection targets in the entire game. Its long start up before it starts dealing big damage will give you ample time to begin reflecting it with your Beta. Just be mindful you can't stun him out of his Alpha due to its armor, so if you try to trade Alphas you’ll be on the backfoot. If he tries to use his uncharged Beta, you can also reflect that to stun him and start potential Combos. Holding your Beta out will likely bait him into going for one of his two most dangerous moves in this match up, his charged Beta, or his Gamma. His Gamma is especially damaging, and can grab you out of your own Gamma, so be on the lookout for those two moves. If he misses his Gamma his recovery is quite punishable, allowing you to spam your Alpha against him. Although Gatlings movement is a lot better than default All Might’s, escape or chase still shouldn’t be a primary concern for Compress here.

## Armored All Might <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch200_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
While this may seem like a good matchup on paper thanks to Compress’ Beta being able to stop all of his skills, this unfortunately isn't enough to trivialize this fight like it does for other characters the Beta fully counters. Armored All Might is able to excel in all ranges thanks to his versatile kit, and while your Beta does stop his long range Alpha shots, his close quarters prowess is what makes this matchup truly difficult. Armored All Might can easily close distance on you using either his Special Action or Beta, where his excellent Melee and Air Melee attacks can easily take advantage of you holding your Beta up. If you drop your Beta to try and counter this however, he can easily start high damage combos using the stun from his Beta or Gamma, or even just by spamming Alpha to freeze you. You really have to try and stun him while he’s stuck in something like his aerial Beta, ground Beta recovery, or Special Action to prevent him from just straight up out damaging you. Even this may not work however, as he can still send his summoned drones after you while stunned, allowing him to stop your Alphas and break out of your combo. If you need to run from Armored All Might you’ll also need to be careful as his Beta can easily grab you out of it, and his tracking drones can stun you in the air. Even if you do teleport away, his superb movement can easily allow him to catch up to you if he knows where you're going. This also means it can be quite difficult to chase him down.

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
While Aizawa’s Alpha can be blocked by your Beta, often allowing you to squeeze an Alpha in between his attempts to grab you, his damage potential and reliable counter to your whole kit easily gives Aizawa the upper hand. When you throw your Alpha in between his attempts to grab you really have to try and aim for a stun or else he can spam his own Alpha to try and start his high damage combos. Aizawa can also easily close distance and dart around you using his aerial Alpha and Beta, making him very hard to hit. Aizawas Gamma is a hard move to fight when on Compress, as its ability to block all shots from his front and sides means you’ll have to be behind him to get a hit on him. If you're able to get the opportunity to attack his exposed behind however he’ll be stuck losing a lot of health. Aizawa's Special Action is unsurprisingly a huge counter against Compress, as not only does it allow for an easy attempt of his grounded Alpha with you not being able to block or fight back, but if you’re in your Gamma’s marble and become affected by it, you’ll be kicked out which ruins your momentum. Finding a good moment to use your Gamma in this fight can already be hard as well, as the pause before your teleport sets him up for an easy grab if you aren't careful. Aizawa's movement is nothing to scoff at either, being able to make good ground regardless if he's running from or chasing you.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Like when fighting most Alpha spam characters, an easy get around to a trigger happy Mic will be to reflect his Alpha with your Beta. This is especially important to do in this match up, as thanks to his Special Action Present Mics Alpha can easily stack up damage even faster than normal. Mic does have some counterplay here, as throwing his radio behind you will let it hit you since your back is turned to it. In close quarters Present Mic players will often go for his easy tap Beta into Gamma combo. If he starts with Beta you can actually block this and attempt to dodge his Gamma after or start stunning him if you're quick. Be careful if he expects this though, as if he does just Gamma he’ll punch you straight through your barrier. If you ever dodge his Gamma, its end lag gives you a good punish opportunity, or gives you time to Gamma away if you're in a bad spot. Just like his tap Beta, you can also block his charged Beta, which shouldn’t be too difficult as its long start up gives ample time for you to put up your Beta. In the event he does knock you down, watch for his tap Beta, as its stun will stop you from teleporting on wake up. In terms of movement, Mic is very outclassed against Compress, and you shouldn’t struggle to run or catch up to him.

## Cementoss <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch101/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch101_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Despite his unique playstyle Cementoss will normally be a good match up for Compress. Both his Alpha and Gamma can be reflected while still in midair, meaning his combo game against Compress is much more limited as it relies on the stun from direct hits for max damage. If you're hit by Alpha or Gamma, recover/roll as fast as possible to try and prevent a follow up attack. Cementoss is great at creating his artificial high ground for both vertical movement and to create a safe spot to heal. Compress’ Gamma is an excellent counter to this however, as it can easily get you above Cementoss to rain Alphas on him. Watch for if he places a Gamma on top however, as it’ll block you from getting above him if you’re too close to the pillar. If he doesn't stack his pillars high enough  you actually won’t need Gamma at all, as simply throwing Alphas from the ground can still let you hit him thanks to the marble's arc and the projectile size. While this primarily covers the counter play outside, fighting Cementoss inside is not advised unless you already have a considerable advantage. His ability to block your exits combined with the fact his moves are super easy to hit inside, will put you at a big disadvantage. 
<br>

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor struggles quite a bit in this match up. His Alpha, while capable of high damage if you aren't careful, is very easy to block and you can react to it after he gets a tick or two worth of hits. His Beta will be his most threatening move thanks to its very high damage, so reflecting it is instrumental in stopping Endeavor's offense. It does offer counterplay against your Beta though, as once it lands on a surface the pillar it makes can’t be blocked anymore. His Gamma is also not blockable. If he misses it or you catch an Endeavor using it against someone else however, him being stuck in the air gives you an excellent opportunity to spam Alphas into him. In the event he knocks you down, try to find cover before using Gamma to get away. Otherwise the pause before the teleport makes you an easy Beta target. The movement granted by Endeavor’s Special Action is far outclassed by Compress’ Gamma.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Much like with Strike Endeavor, Inferno Fist’s Beta is the move you’ll want to watch for. Its spawn AOE and ability to drag you back inside can make for a lethal trap, so it's best to just Gamma out in most situations. If Inferno Fist tries to melt you with Alphas while you're stuck, reflect them with your Beta until he stops before you use Gamma to discourage him from following. If he tries to use his Gamma, teleport instantly to avoid it. In the event you don’t have Gamma available, you can reflect his Gamma too, but only while it's airborne. Once it hits the ground you’ll need to run. If you're ever in the open holding your Beta against him, be aware you’re an easy target for his Beta and that you’ll need to watch for it. His movement is the same as his base, so still not great.

## Hawks (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch043/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch043_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Hawks only really has one good move in this match up and that is his Beta. Its near guaranteed shield break and being a super easy method to knock you down already make it great. The additional movement on hit it provides him is the cherry on top though, as Hawks become much harder to hit with his increased speed and can easily follow up on you. If he misses his first Beta it is easy to punish however. His slow moving auto-track Alpha sucks, and will do very little damage before you can react and block it. A Hawks who can quickly beam with the aimed version before moving again is much harder to react to. His Gamma is easy to dodge and reflectable too, so make sure to attempt the reflect whenever you see him do his spin. Even with his nerfs his movement is nothing to scoff at, and if you get outlined by his Gamma you may have difficulty running away.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Slicing Wind only really has one truly problematic move for Compress in his Gamma. Its combo potential, and large hitbox make it very dangerous if you can’t avoid it. Try and recover as quickly as possible to prevent follow ups if you're hit by this attack. Like most Alpha’s, Slicing Wind’s is reflected right back at him, so make sure you're ready to send them back at him when needed. His Beta is sort of an awkward move to characterize. While it is damaging if he lands it, it can be dodged fairly easily and leaves him very open to punish if he misses. His movement is quite good, comparable to Compress’, so it may be difficult to run or catch up to Slicing Wind if he has his cooldowns.

## Mt Lady <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch100/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch100_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Mt. Lady is an excellent close range fighter, and ideally someone you want to interact with from a nice middleground. This highly limits her damage options and forces her to make a play to try and get in which you can predict, or spam her Alpha which you can reflect. Highground is ideal though as it's much harder for her to reach and she wastes moves to get up. If Mt Lady ever gets too close to you, you should try and Gamma away since that's where she excels. Do be careful though, as her stomps can stun you out of it. If she ever knocks you down her Beta will be her best wake up catch option, so avoid that as best as possible. Her movement is quite poor, so you’ll outclass her there. Her giant form isn’t particularly bad unless you're right beside her making you an easy target. Her Alpha is incredibly easy to reflect thanks to its slow speed, and her Beta is easily dodged by teleporting into the air. Her Gamma will be the only real threat as its huge hitbox means you aren't safe in the sky. If she ever enters this mode, try your best to disengage as fast as possible, as her huge damage reduction and insane damage make winning a fight almost impossible if she's even kind of healthy. 

## Tomura Shigaraki (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch015_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Unfortunately for Shigiraki he really struggles to do much to Compress. His Alpha and Beta being grounded when Compress can easily fly into the air or get high ground with his Gamma means he lacks the ability to deal consistent damage to you. His Alpha also leaves him open to a counter attack since he's stationary using it. Even when you don’t have Gamma available, jumping over and over to stay off the ground until you get it back will negate some damage. You do need to keep in mind his Alpha and Beta can travel up surfaces though, so you aren't entirely safe when you are on top of buildings. If Shigiraki tries to Gamma you, dodge towards him so he runs right past you. It’ll grab you through your Gamma’s armor so using it won’t be a safe option to get away. His Gamma and Special Action being his movement sources means you won’t struggle to run or catch up to him. Shigiraki really isn't scary unless you’re in a small final circle or inside a building with him. Try and avoid those situations and he shouldn't be an issue.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Catastrophe) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Catastrophe is another character utilizing stuns like Compress. While you can reflect both his Alpha and Beta, he can easily get around this by throwing them at the ground instead to damage you. This means you’ll have to be smart using it, as just holding it out will invite unwanted damage while you do nothing back to him. If he's close to you Catastrophe can also go for his Gamma instead, allowing him to start his combos. If you’re ever hit by one of these combos you’ll also be taking a ton of damage which’ll force you to flee. Fortunately he isn’t too good at catching your wake up or stopping your Gamma. The best thing to try and do in this match up is just get the stun on him first if you're close, or stay above him and rain down your Alpha. Fortunately your Gamma is great movement against Catastrophe, so he can’t outrun or chase you well.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
When it comes to AFO’s base kit you’ll be having quite a back and forth match up. Like all Alphas if AFO spams it against you it’ll be very easy to reflect it back. You can reflect the charged version too, and thanks to its slow movement speed you can actually walk into its path on missed shots to ensure it's reflected. His Beta will be his counter to you, as it's quite large and can’t be reflected or blocked. Its ability to go through walls also gives AFO an option to stop you from following him in or out of buildings. His Gamma is a very back and forth move here. Dodging this move leaves AFO wide open to a counter attack or it’ll allow you an opportunity to escape him. Its lack of Armour also means you can stun him out of it if you're close enough. Mistiming a dodge however gives AFO a free combo which is almost guaranteed to do huge damage. This move also can’t be dodged while you’re in the air, which is a problem for Compress since he’s in it so often thanks to his Gamma. When approaching AFO or using Gamma in an area you know one is in, try when possible to make sure he’s already used his Gamma so you won’t be caught in it while airborne. His base kit doesn't have any movement. AFO’s stolen quirks will offer an additional challenge to you depending on what he has in the pocket. Any quirks that provide him movement will be what you want to watch for, as a 400HP character with the potential to run or catch up to you can make for a scary fight.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Compress’ Beta is a real pain for Young AFO to deal with. Like most, his Alpha will be reflected if he attempts to spam it against you, and the explosion afterward will be blocked as well. His uncharged Beta will also be blocked, however depending on your spacing the ball that lands behind you can still hit Compress’ back on occasion, so be wary. While his charged Beta does get around yours, Young AFO leaves himself open to be stunned when charging it, and its slow fall time also gives you opportunity to run away if he gets it off. The real issue with Young AFO however is just how hard it is to actually fight back against him when he’s in the air. While in his Gamma, he can get incredibly high up, making it almost impossible to fight back from the ground, especially since he can constantly knock you down with Gamma energy blasts. While these too can be reflected by Beta, it really limits your options as you're more or less forced to run so you don’t get hit by the charged Gamma’s large radius. His Beta allowing him to hover, alongside his Special Action flight, allows him to stay high up for an even longer time. While you can get decently high up yourself, you don't float like he does and his Gamma armor stops you stunning him too. He becomes even more oppressive alongside teammates who make the ground unsafe. His Special Action alone is also a very good movement tool to help him escape from or chase you.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Dabi is another character who really just can’t touch Compress outside of close range. Engage Dabi from a mid range or from above and he shouldn’t be an issue. Although his Alpha tracks you, its slow speed makes it very easy to dodge, and even easier to reflect. His Beta only deals damage when you run over it, so watch for where he places it in a fight. Your Alpha is great at setting them off from range, as the large projectile size and shockwave can both set them off. Dabi’s Beta can also eat projectiles to protect himself. Unfortunately for Dabi, this only includes the marble portion of your Alpha since the object persists until it touches the ground. While the object will fly past if he remains inside the trap's radius, if he continues to run he might get hit anyway. If you chase Dabi into a building his traps will be a much bigger problem in the enclosed space. He can also use them to block exits to stop you fleeing. His Gamma is his best tool against Compress thanks to it actually fully blocking your Alpha. If you're outside, simply Gamma over it to rain Alphas from above. If Gamma is unavailable he still can’t do much to you since as long as you're outside the radius, his Alpha is his only option to hit you. Inside buildings his Gamma is much better since you can’t teleport over it, and it can go through walls to hit you on the other side. He doesn’t have movement to run or chase.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Crazy Torch’s simple game plan of run up and Beta you can work both great and poorly against Compress. On one hand he becomes very easy to predict, often running at you in a straight line and inviting you to stun them with Alpha. You can even stun him out of his Beta before he hits you. Getting stunned like this while also draining their own HP if their Gamma is active puts Crazy Torch in a very bad spot. If he can hit you though, Compress can really struggle since the grab knocks you down on hit. Compress hates these wake up catch scenarios, and Crazy Torch is great at them thanks to his Betas tracking. If you try and Gamma  he can just Beta you again to either DOWN you or get you very low. It's very important to keep track of how many Beta’s Crazy Torch has (max 2), because if you’re alive after the second one is used you know he can’t catch you anymore and you can Gamma away. His Gamma is another good counter to you though, as the small fire shockwaves it produces will block your Alpha from hitting him, and also all but guarantee you won’t be able to finish a combo on him thanks to it knocking you away if you're going for a melee. His alpha isn't very problematic for you, and his Beta being his movement means his best offense is wasted if he uses it to run.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Togas Beta will be her best move in this fight. Its quick movement speed and ability to knock you down even through your Gamma’s armor can make it difficult to counter. You can stun her out of this move however, so if you dodge it try and either punish her with Alphas or Gamma to distance yourself. Her Alpha has a shockingly long range for what it is, so you're not safe just because you’re out of her Beta distance. It can also stack damage fast if you aren’t careful, so make sure to reflect it when possible. Toga’s Gamma can be blocked by your Beta, so always try and stop it when it comes out. If you don't, she'll be able to either refresh cancel her abilities similar to Monoma, or can chase or run using your own mobility. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Sting Dance is another hard to hit aerial character that Compress struggles with. Thanks to her fantastic air mobility, Sting dance is often darting around above you and not giving many opportunities to counter attack her until she's back on the ground. While her Alpha is reflectable and her Gamma can be blocked, her Beta can bypass it and stun you, allowing for an easy Gamma follow up from her. You especially don’t want Sting Dance to start cooldown refreshing as normally her moves won’t start reloading until she's touched the ground. Giving her the option to reset in the air is not good. While she's in the air it's best to just try and dodge her until she makes a mistake or runs out of moves and is forced to land. If she misses a Gamma for example, she's slow to recover, which gives you the chance to try and stun her. You can also get into the air yourself using Gamma, which will prevent her Beta from hitting you since it only hits below her. If she transforms into you for a mirror match, check the Mr. Compress match up.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
The match up against Mr. Compress is not kind to Twice at all. For starters he’s one of the four characters who can have all of their moves stopped by Compress’ Beta. Simply holding out your Beta to Twice almost completely stops him. His only real option is to try and melee you, which isn't a terrible option thanks to the slide making it hit from an unexpected distance. Learn to expect this and dodge it, and Twice is incredibly punishable on a miss. The only other way for him to get around this is to hope a clone of a player he previously downed counters Compress. His alpha is reflected, his Beta can be blocked, and the clones low health means its Alpha spam will kill itself if it is summoned. His Gamma is also blocked, and is also pretty poor for movement. Just wait for a mistake, and Twice can virtually never win this fight.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
 Due to the threat of your Compress’ Alpha stun, a lot of this match up can be spent with both parties holding their own Beta and trying to predict when the other will drop theirs. If you want to aggress in this situation, try closing the distance on your mirror but in a diagonal line so you’re harder to hit, and throw some jumps in there as well. From here, you can stagger Alphas to try and predict the enemy dropping their Beta. Approaching on a diagonal while jumping ensures any reflected Alphas don’t stun you back as long as you aren't too close. If you predict right you can start your own Alpha combo. If that's too risky for you, another option is to play it safe by attempting to react to them dropping their Beta instead and then using Alpha, but this will require a quick reaction time. Some Compress players are very wary of opposing Alphas, and may not drop their Beta at all. In these situations you’re more or less forced to close the distance to start potential melee combos. If you're on the defense it's best to keep your Beta up like this. If an attempt to close ground for a melee is made you can use your Gamma, as its armor will protect you from any melee stun and will damage your opponent back with the smoke bomb. You can also roll out of Beta, so consider rolling backwards and then using Alpha to stun an opponent stuck in the melee animation. Always remember an enemy Compress could do this to you when you approach them too. You may also be tempted to Gamma into the air and use Alpha from above. You should always try and be the second Compress to do this though. Assuming your opponent Gammas into the air, you can Gamma up after them immediately. This prevents them from hitting you while they’re above, and makes you harder to hit and locate in general. If they choose to go higher with their second Gamma, go up after them again. This leaves you as the Compress with the high ground as your opponent is stuck falling below you, and they can only try and Beta to save themselves. This also gives you a good opportunity to land on them for an easy melee combo. If you went up first, they could do this to you. Because your movement is the same, the previous idea also applies here. If you're the first to Gamma away, the other Compress can always catch you, so try and force the other to run first. For the most part you want to try and use Gamma second.

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Kurogiri is the final character who is completely stopped by your Beta. Against your Beta his Alpha will be reflected, and his Beta will be blocked. This means just like Twice you can more or less just wait for him to make a mistake to punish him. Kurogiri is another one of the characters who can just outrun Compress if he’s put on the back foot however, as his portals go crazy distances you just can’t keep up with. Additionally, if a Kurogiri is able to hit you with his Beta, locking you into something like his quad Beta combo does absolutely ridiculous damage and will immediately put you at a major disadvantage. Even some of his other combos can be quite threatening. If he ever sends his Gamma ball after you keep in mind his Alphas will be blocked rather than reflected. This means you will have to shoot it down, which fortunately isn't too hard with your Alpha's massive size. If Kurogiri is trying to air stall in his Gamma, Gamma up after him and hit him while he's stuck up there to try and force him down.

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Overhaul is another fairly grounded character who can struggle against Compress’ aerial movement. Staying on top of high ground or in the air above him will be your best option, as this invalidates pretty much his whole kit. While he can semi-counter you sitting on high ground with his Beta, he struggles to follow up on any damage he deals this way. His Gamma will be his scariest move, as it stops you from using your own Gamma if it catches you, and can combo into itself or any of his other moves. It's also very good for catching your wake up if he ever knocks you down. He does pause to use both his Beta and Gamma however, so if he ever misses these attacks you can punish him with Alpha stuns. His Special Action can end any melee combos you attempt on him so there's no point in using that as a punish option unless you know he's used it up. He can also heal up for free using it, making it a bit harder to take him down. Like most grounded characters, Overhaul will only get the upper hand on you when fighting in small or enclosed spaces where his Gamma is easy to hit. Avoiding these situations is the key to success when fighting Overhaul.
