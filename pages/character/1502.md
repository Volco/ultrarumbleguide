An arrogant master of destruction that eradicates anything in his path, Thousand-Hand Break Shigaraki is a high damage output monster with incredible utility through Search and Super Regeneration. He excels at controlling space with wall-piercing pressure and large hitboxes, while outlasting opponents in extended fights through his regeneration and movement. His range, high damage, control, movement, and survivability make him a character who is difficult to bring down or escape from.

## Alpha Skill - Thousand-Hand Break

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var02/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique1.png" width="400" /></br> 
</p>

After a short startup, Shigaraki launches a wave of fingers in a straight line that pierces through walls and opponents, dealing high damage. At the beginning of the move, a small activation hitbox appears around Shigaraki that briefly stuns nearby enemies. This activation hitbox is a key mechanic to most of his combos and is covered in more detail in the Advanced Gameplay section.

## Alpha Skill - Search

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var02/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique1_2.png" width="400" /></br> 
</p>

While aiming with spare Alpha ammo, Search consumes one Alpha charge to reveal opponents through walls and display their HP and GP on your screen. (You CANNOT use search without alpha ammo to consume). This information helps prioritize targets and plan engagements. A helpful detail is that any opponent visible through Search is guaranteed to be within Thousand-Hand Break's range.

## Beta Skill - Shake Heaven and Earth
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var02/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique2.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Shigaraki’s Beta skill is what makes him a dangerous presence on the battlefield. Using Beta, he leaps forward while summoning a massive fist that trails behind him. Upon landing, he releases two shockwaves: a smaller, initial one that does some damage and stuns the opponents, followed by a larger, more damaging, high-down-power shockwave that can devastate enemies caught in it. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502b-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>


The distance traveled is tied to camera direction, so aiming diagonally upward until the ground is out of view gives you maximum range when used on the ground. The move can be canceled mid-animation to chain into another Beta, allowing Shigaraki to travel farther or adjust his trajectory. The pre-leap can also be canceled by rolling, letting him reposition without fully committing. 

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502b2-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>


At any point during the jump, Shigaraki has an active collision hitbox on himself that deals the full Beta damage and down power to anyone he touches during the jump, making him a threat even before landing and the shockwaves. This beta body hitbox, combined with the canceling of the beta, allows him to hit opponents in the air more easily.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502b3-gif.gif" width="400" /></br>
</p>

## Gamma Skill - Super Regeneration
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/Variation/Var02/GUI/Skill/T_ui_Skill_Ch015_Unique3.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>
Shigaraki’s Gamma skill provides passive healing for both GP and HP, lasting seven seconds at level one and increasing by a second with each level, reaching a maximum of fifteen seconds at level nine. While active, Gamma applies a Decay DoT effect to opponents hit by Shigaraki’s Alpha or Beta skills, as well as any enemies nearby. This effect can spread between opponents, dealing approximately 30 HP per application (3 HP per second for 10 seconds), though it will not reduce a target below 1 HP. The Decay can be reapplied if an enemy stays too close to Shigaraki or another affected opponent, or if his Alpha or Beta strikes them while his Gamma is active.

(video of the gamma damage here)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502y-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The duration of Gamma can also be extended through combat. Striking opponents with Alpha restores a portion of the Gamma meter, with each hit providing 25% and a full Alpha contributing 75% (though the “upon activation” close-range hitbox offers an extra 50%). Beta’s body collision hitbox restores 50% of the meter, and the two shockwaves each restore 25%, totaling 50% if both connect. Hitting multiple targets increases the amount gained, and receiving damage from opponents adds 5%. You can still gain gamma percent on downed people.

(video of it gaining ammo here)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502y2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Healing per second increases with skill level, starting at 4 GP and HP per second at level 1, rising to 5 at level 4, and reaching 6 at level 9. Gamma allows Shigaraki to maintain his presence in battle while continuously applying Decay, making him a persistent threat and difficult to pressure in prolonged fights.

## Special Action - Collapse Hand
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch015/GUI/Skill/T_ui_SpecialSkill_Ch015.png" width="400" /></br>
</p>

Collapse Hand deals 80 damage to opponents while applying a -20% Defense debuff, making it a strong tool for punishing wake-ups. Its tracking is similar to Melee 3, allowing you to call out opponents who try to get up or use an escape tool, and the debuff makes combos even scarier while amplifying team damage on a single target.

The Jump version of Collapse Hand is effective for catching airborne opponents, and as of Season 13, Collapse Hand received a small but impactful adjustment. Its aerial movement speed was increased, and the skill now begins reloading only after Shigaraki lands on the ground. When no target is in range, it generally travels toward your camera at 60 FPS. 

Collapse Hand also destroys constructs on contact, including Cementoss pillars and environmental obstacles like buildings in USJ’s Collapse Zone. It can be used twice in quick succession midair, providing extra mobility and versatility in both offense and repositioning.

As of recently, Collapse Hand sometimes sends you the wrong direction if you just landed or touched a wall (or under certain unique conditions).

</p>

## Basic Attacks
### Ground Melee</br>
Shigaraki’s ground melee is a three-hit combo that deals roughly 120 damage. The third hit has notably strong forward lunge and tracking, making it reliable at close range. Despite this, ground melee is generally outclassed by other options in his kit, which offer better damage, utility, or combo routing in most situations.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502m-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>
</br>

### Air Melee <br>
Shigaraki’s air melee functions as a serviceable aerial callout, but his aerial Special Action vastly overshadows it. Collapse Hand offers superior tracking, higher damage, and a defense-debuffing effect, making it a much stronger choice for contesting airborne opponents. Air melee can still help start Alpha-based combo routes, which are covered in advanced gameplay, but its high down power of 250 often ends pressure prematurely. As a result, it is usually a secondary option rather than a core part of Shigaraki’s neutral or combo game.

</p>

## Leveling Paths
### Balanced Path
This path is for players who want access to everything Shigaraki offers without overcommitting to a single strength. Gamma level 4 provides meaningful sustain that really helps, especially with the extra healing per second and increased time. Alpha level 4 is also prioritized early, for the extra ammo often matters more than Beta’s level 4 upgrades. Fully upgrading Gamma to level 9 is a significant spike thanks to the increased healing and duration, making midgame fights far more forgiving. Alpha benefits greatly from additional ammo and damage at higher levels, while Beta, although strong with reduced cooldowns and increased area at level 9, already performs well at lower investment. Sometimes it may not even be worth leveling beta till alpha and gamma are maxxed.

</p>

### Balanced Aggressor Path
This route favors a more aggressive, damage-focused playstyle and is commonly used when not running Revenge-based tunings. While Gamma’s healing remains valuable, it is less critical when you are actively pressuring opponents and ending fights quickly. Alpha is prioritized after the initial level 4 spread to maximize damage output and ammo economy. Gamma is still brought to level 4, as it is hard to gain value at lower levels, followed by Beta 4, and then maxing either Beta or Alpha for stronger engagement and area control. Gamma is completed last, providing sustain once damage options are complete.

### Optimal Regeneration Path
This path shines when paired with Revenge tunings, particularly Revenge Assault or Revenge Support, and emphasizes survivability above all else. Fully upgrading Gamma as early as possible gives Shigaraki immense sustain, making him extremely difficult to kill in the early stages of a match. Although rushing Gamma to level 9 can feel awkward if progress is slow, the payoff is significant once achieved, and makes you very hard to kill at the start of the match. If Gamma upgrades are taking too long to secure, pivoting briefly to Alpha level 4 for the extra ammo is a practical adjustment. Once Gamma is complete, Alpha and Beta are leveled to round out damage and ammo.

## Techs
### Alpha

Alpha has an activation hitbox that appears slightly after the skill is pressed. This hitbox is surprisingly large, roughly three times Shigaraki’s size, and lingers for nearly a full second even if the Alpha itself is canceled before the arms extend. At all levels, this activation hitbox deals approximately 25 damage and 50 down power, and in most situations, it hits twice, resulting in 50 damage and 100 down power total.

This property can be abused by activating Alpha and immediately rolling out before the arms fully extend, which refunds the ammo cost. By allowing the activation hitbox to connect and then canceling the move, Shigaraki can repeatedly stagger opponents without committing to the full Alpha animation or using any ammo. Repeating this sequence keeps enemies locked in hitstun while maintaining full ammo, making it a powerful, pressure-based control tool good for combos or catching wakeups.

This activation hitbox forms the foundation of many of Shigaraki’s combo routes. Because Alpha can be safely canceled and refunded, it allows for constant re-engagement without overcommitting. Combined with the size and persistence of the activation hitbox, this strongly incentivizes using Alpha from the ground, where you can roll and have a better shot at hitting opponents. However, aerial Alpha use remains viable as you can still catch people with this activation hitbox in the air (but you are forced to continue with the full Alpha instead). It is important to note that for some combos, Alpha will bring the opponents closer to the front of where Tech Shigaraki is facing (though only slightly; it helps with some of the more complex combos).

(vids here showcasing alpha rolling)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t1-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

One important limitation of Alpha is its poor performance against shields. If the activation hitbox or the extended arms connect with a shield, even through multiple walls, the attack will deal no damage, and Shigaraki will be briefly knocked back and staggered. This makes careless Alpha usage risky in matchups against characters with shields, as it can interrupt pressure and leave you momentarily vulnerable. Though some shields only partially block alpha damage.

(vid where Shiggy gets knockback by a shield)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t2-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p> 

That all said, his Alpha can effectively function as a temporary shield or wall, blocking both enemy and ally projectiles from passing through its hands, similar to how Aizawa’s Gamma behaves. The moment the prediction for the alpha skill appears (doesn’t even have to be the attack), shots will be blocked almost like they are hitting a wall. Certain moves that stick to surfaces (yellow shigaraki alpha, Younga afo alpha) will get stuck or stop in that position.

In addition, Alpha has a bug where, after passing through walls, it can become slightly pushed or tilted off its typical trajectory. This altered angle can make the attack much harder for opponents to read and dodge, unintentionally increasing its effectiveness in certain situations.

(Shiggy blocking projectile with alpha) (footage of alpha moving)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t3-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Additionally, the Search function tied to Alpha has notable restrictions. While it allows Shigaraki to see enemies through walls, it lets them know he can see them. (By highlighting them in blue and showing a green arrow on their screen pointing to your location). It also does not reveal the health, GP, or position of invisible characters (Froppy Gamma, Froppy Tuning, Tamaki Beta). As a result, certain matchups can become significantly harder depending on the opponent’s tools, requiring more cautious positioning and reliance on prediction rather than information.

(vid showcasing this interaction and green arrow)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t4-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Furthermore, since aiming in will always consume alpha ammo if you have any to spare, you need to be more careful and use it more sparingly compared to other characters (especially if you use alpha to make looking in specific directions easier). Furthermore, searching sometimes (usually at the start of a match) takes about half a second longer to display enemy positions.

Alpha has surprisingly low down power for a move of its type. While his Alpha deals high damage and typically hits around three times when it connects directly from the front, excluding the activation hitbox and Gamma-related interactions discussed later, each of these hits only carries about 10 down power. This is usually not an issue, as by the time Shigaraki recovers from his Alpha’s recoil, opponents often enter wake-up frames.

However, this low-down power can be deliberately exploited in coordinated play. When working closely with teammates, having them apply additional stun immediately after Alpha connects prevents opponents from entering invincibility frames because they are still being attacked. Similarly, effects such as Electrification, which are covered in the T.U.N.I.N.G. and Combo sections, can keep enemies locked in hitstun. By denying wake-up opportunities in this way, Shigaraki can repeatedly land multiple Alphas in succession, abusing the move’s low-down power to deal very high damage before opponents can escape.

(vid here showing it in action (like the afo vid that was in clips))
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t5-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Alpha has a bug when interacting with Gamma. When Gamma is active, the opponent has GP, and Alpha is used in the open, the damage dealt to opponents becomes extremely inconsistent. In many cases, Alpha will fail to register most of its hits and may connect only once. Opponents also appear to enter wake-up frames more quickly when they have GP and are hit by Alpha while Gamma is active, which seems to be what's reducing Alpha’s effective damage.

(a video of that happening)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t6-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

When Alpha is used with Gamma active against opponents with HP, it deals full damage, but it now forces the opponent downward into the ground rather than behaving normally (the opponent won't take knockback). However, when Alpha pierces through a wall, it will still deal full damage even while Gamma is active, regardless of whether the target has HP or GP. This bug is most likely caused by the Decay effect applied by Alpha while Gamma is active.

(vid of HP slamming people and it working fully on GP through a wall)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t7-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Beta

When using Beta for movement, canceling it right before landing by activating the skill
again can be extremely useful for repositioning or avoiding the end lag. This allows Shigaraki to preserve momentum and disengage or adjust positioning without committing to the whole animation.

However, after canceling Beta in this way, you must either roll (usually the preferred option) or eventually use the Beta charge that was consumed to perform the cancel.

(vid here of beta canceling)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t8-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

The beta's prediction line isn't always accurate and will sometimes stop prematurely if something blocks Shigaraki's path or if he is too close to a surface.

(vid of it showing it's going over a building, but not)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t9-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Once Beta reaches higher levels, usually around level 9, it becomes a powerful tool for quickly downing opponents. Because Beta has a body collision hitbox in addition to its two shockwaves, a downed opponent can be hit by all three of them if the angle and placement are correct (try to do it when you are nearby them). Since downed players do not receive down power, every hit deals full damage, and they do not gain invincibility frames.

At level 9 with no tuning, placing Beta directly on top of a downed target while standing very close allows the body hit to deal 200 damage, followed by shockwaves dealing 80 and 120 damage. Combined, this is enough to eliminate most opponents with a single move when executed properly. Some tuning setups allow this interaction to work as early as levels 7 or 8, and with Gamma active, it may be possible at even lower levels. Additionally, using Collapse Hand before landing all three Beta hits can instantly finish a downed opponent at any level.

(quick down video)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t10-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

### Gamma

Shigaraki’s Gamma holds him in place when he presses the button to activate it. Because he is defenseless during this time, it is generally recommended to activate Gamma in locations where he is at least a bit unlikely to be interrupted. That said, Gamma can be canceled freely, which allows it to function as flexibly as a healing ability.

One of Gamma’s most useful applications comes from its cancellation behavior. Since Gamma locks Shigaraki’s position and canceling it has no penalty, it can be activated in the air, canceled, and then reactivated repeatedly. This allows Shigaraki to stall himself midair while gaining Gamma meter, as the skill reloads faster than it consumes ammo. This stalling can be used to wait for cooldowns, reposition safely, or avoid ground pressure. Mixing in short Beta movements along the sides of buildings while Gamma is active further enhances this, allowing Shigaraki to heal HP and GP before returning to aerial stalling.

(video of gamma stalling in the air)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t11-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Furthermore, Gamma continues to heal Shigaraki even while he has invincibility frames. When Shigaraki is knocked down, he typically gains around five seconds of i-frames, during which Gamma remains active and provides free healing. Because of this, playing Technical Shigaraki often involves intentionally stalling out knockdown i-frames whenever possible to maximize this “free” Gamma regeneration. 
When paired with tunings like Critical Permeation or Revenge Support, this effect becomes especially strong, allowing Shigaraki to recover a significant amount of HP and GP without taking any risk. This interaction is a major part of why Gamma-centric setups are so effective, and it will be covered in more detail in the tuning section.

(vid of healing during I-frames)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t12-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

Gamma does not heal HP while Shigaraki is inside the storm, so it is important not to rely on Gamma sustain during storm fights. While it will still function normally outside, entering the storm significantly reduces Technical Shigaraki’s survivability. Because of this, you should avoid extended engagements in the storm whenever possible and prioritize repositioning to safe zones where Gamma healing can actually take effect. That said, since it still heals your GP in storm, you will have an advantage when fighting in storm.

(vid of gamma only healing gp in storm)
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/gifs/1502t13-gif.gif" width="400" />
</p>

It is generally recommended to avoid letting Gamma fully deplete to zero. While Gamma does reload faster when empty, maintaining at least some charge gives you the option to manually activate it at will, allowing controlled healing and meter management. Keeping Gamma available provides more flexibility and defensive options in most situations.

Gamma becomes significantly stronger when paired with tuning. Because Gamma continuously restores GP, opponents fighting Technical Shigaraki will frequently break his shield, which repeatedly triggers Revenge-based tuning effects that activate on guard break. While this can also enable opponent tuning effects that activate when Shigaraki is guardbroken, such as Electrification or Quirk Factor Release, the defensive benefits far outweigh this drawback (mainly because the ones where the opponent is guardbroken usually have cooldowns anyway). Gamma-centric tuning setups are exceptionally powerful, and their full impact on Shigaraki’s kit will be covered in detail in the tuning section below.

</p>

        
## Combos
This section covers the different ways Shigaraki can combine and chain his skills to deal high damage while managing the 500 DP (Down Power) knockdown threshold. Because many of Shigaraki’s strongest tools apply relatively high DP per hit, or are hard to combo with, understanding how each part of his kit contributes to Down Power is key to maximizing damage before a forced knockdown occurs.

Alpha Skill: 25 DP (startup, often hits twice though), 10 DP (Full alpha arms, often hits three times when gamma isn’t active)<br>
Beta Skill: 500 DP (Body shot), 10 + 500 DP (Beta shockwaves)<br>
Gamma Skill: 0 DP (however, causes alpha not to be as consistent)<br>
Ground Melee 1-2-3: 100 DP (Individually), 300 DP (Whole Chain)<br>
Air Melee: 250 DP<br>
Special Action: 200 DP

Unique:
Since Tech Shigaraki has very low DP on his alpha, he would be able to combo into another alpha if the endlag on the alpha wasn’t so high. Using Electrification, though, you can combo two alphas together if you manage to guardbreak the opponent with the first one, which makes Electrification quite strong.


The text of the combos below will be colored by how true they are. In this case, we will define "True" combos as those that, without 3rd-party or tuning interference, can only be escaped/interrupted by Overhaul and/or Mirio, as they are special cases.
<br>
White Text means that part of the combo is True on both GP and HP.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(92,255,119,255) !important;">**Green Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on HP only.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;">**Blue Text**</a> means that part of the combo is True if the target is on GP only (Guardbreak hits are considered GP hits).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Purple Text**</a> means that part of the combo is only true when Electrification is activated.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Red Text**</a> means that part of the combo is Untrue, and therefore the enemy can escape it.<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,192,203,255) !important;">**Pink Text**</a> means the combo is still true, but may not fully work or may be inconsistent with gamma active due to the alpha bug (as discussed earlier).<br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Multi-colored options mean</a> <a style="color: rgba(255,192,203,255) !important;">both colored statements are included**</a>.<br>

The DMG of the following combos at max level and accounting for the character's Strike role is classified under the following tags:<br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,244,169,255) !important;">**Basic DMG (100-149 DMG), Basic+ DMG (150-199)**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Light DMG (200-249 DMG), Light+ DMG (250-299)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,174,69,255) !important;">**Medium DMG (300-349 DMG), Medium+ DMG (350-399)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(255,104,69,255) !important;">**High DMG (400-449 DMG), High+ DMG (450-499)**</a><br>
<a style="color: red !important;">**Heavy DMG (500-549 DMG), Heavy+ DMG (550-599)**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(230,59,161,255) !important;">**Deadly DMG (600-649 DMG), Deadly+ DMG (650-699)**</a><br>

Alpha startup will be a base for most of his combos, but you can remove some of them for shorter combos, less down power, and less damage, depending on the situation. Also, full alpha is only true when you connect the alpha startup, so those two together are just pressing the alpha key.

### Special Action -> Alpha Startup -> Alpha Startup -> <a style="color: rgba(255,192,203,255) !important;">Full Alpha</a> 

It is hard, but not impossible, to combo off the special action. In some cases, when you have the high ground, it is easier to hit, but even if you don't hit the combo, the damage debuff from the special action will help you out.

### Alpha startup -> Alpha startup -> Alpha startup -> Alpha startup -> <a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;"> Beta Body Shot</a> 

Beta has slightly too long a windup to be entirely true; however, opponents will often get hit by at least a shockwave. This makes it a good move when your gamma is active or if you really want to squeeze out extra damage. Replacing all the full alpha combos above with a beta lowers the chance of you hitting it, but raises the overall damage and makes you less reliant on not having gamma for combos.

## Electrification Combos

Combos that incorporate Electrification are powerful. Electrification has a cooldown and requires the opening portion of the combo to deal enough damage to guardbreak, but because Full Alpha has relatively low Down Power, if you are close enough to the opponent, you can easily follow up after triggering Electrification with additional Alpha hits or other combos. Beta Body Shot, when used after Electrification, actually becomes true. Furthermore, since these combos usually rely on the Alpha startup, it doesn’t take too much ammo away from Shigaraki in most combos, leaving him still ready to fight the opponent.

Note: These Electrification combos can fail if the opponent is guardbroken at an unintended time. To make them consistent, we’ll sort combos by the amount of GP the opponent needs for the combo to work. If you’re using builds that increase damage for certain moves (like Alpha attack power), you may need to adjust these combos accordingly.

Opponents hit with Electrification after decay activate will remove the decay effect.

You can combine so many possibilities into Electrification without these setups. I'm giving some areas of GP where these setups allow the user to get more consistent, high damage combos. (for example: you can do full alpha, Electrification, full alpha, but it would usually only work in ranges of 125 GP - 200ish GP)

## **Opponent needs at least 153 GP**

## **Opponent needs at least 176 GP**

### Melee 1 -> Alpha Startup -> Alpha Startup -> <a style="color: rgba(255,192,203,255) !important;">Full Alpha</a> (needs to guardbreak on last hits) -> <a style="color: rgba(51,116,255,255) !important;"> Electr</a><a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">ification</a> -> <a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">Beta</a>

This one is mostly consistent if the opponent has at least about 176 GP (or about 186ish if you start with melee 2 which is only 10 damage more).

This one is hard and sometimes inconsistent to do. However, if it is pulled off, it's essentially entirely true.

## **Opponent needs at MOST 210 GP**

Tech Shigaraki’s highest damaging combo. Note: gamma active is optional as it makes it way harder to land the alpha at the start; however, with it on, you get about 30ish extra decay dot damage if you are really pushing damage numbers (I don’t recommend it):

</p>

## **Opponent needs at MOST 150 GP**

These combos are less consistent because the opponent needs to have less than 150 GP (which you can roughly estimate with Search). The advantage is that they don’t rely on Full Alpha, so you can reliably execute them even with Gamma active. They are also quite good against Tech Shiggy, as you can easily pull these off at lower GP’s.

The idea is to Alpha Startup your opponent until you guardbreak them. Note that you cannot do more than three Alpha Startups before Electrification, or the guardbreak will down them and prevent further combos.

## **Opponent needs at MOST 140 GP**

This one is a similar concept. You Special Action them, and you can do one optional alpha startup roll (if they don’t have less than 80 gp), which will lead to a guardbreak and a beta. This is about as niche as I'll get because even though it's good for when you have gamma active, some other combos are better, especially considering how hard it is to land Special Action.

## **Opponent needs at MOST 120 GP**

This one is just for melee tuning setups, and gamma is active.

## Recommended Normal & Special Tunes
### Normal Tunes
<a style="color: rgba(255,100,100,255) !important;">**Strike Slots: Beta/Alpha DMG -> HP DMG -> GP DMG -> Gamma DMG**</a><br>
<a style="color: yellow !important;">**Assault Slots: Endeavor-> All Might -> Kirishima -> Else -> Melee Defense**</a><br>
<a style="color: cyan !important;">**Rapid Slots: Izuku (OFA) -> Mirio -> Twice -> Toga -> Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: lime !important;">**Support Slots:  Ibara -> Overhaul -> Kurogiri -> Momo -> Else**</a><br>
<a style="color: rgba(175,100,237,255) !important;">**Technical Slots: Denki -> All For One -> Todoroki -> Mirio -> Else**</a><br>

Optimal normal tuning for Technical Shigaraki differs little from his base options. HP damage is slightly more valuable than usual because his kit deals high damage through mostly multi-hit attacks, letting him benefit consistently from the bonus damage when opponents are already on HP. That said, raw Alpha and Beta damage tuning is generally stronger overall and will provide more consistent value across most situations.

One important thing to keep in mind is that Gamma attack power tuning should usually be avoided unless it also comes with a secondary benefit (because your gamma doesn’t do direct damage, it doesn’t affect its damage value). Overhaul tuning, however, is perfectly fine to run, mainly because of the additional HP it provides. Extra HP synergizes well with Shigaraki’s natural regeneration, especially when combined with Revenge Support.

### Special Tunes

Mainly ordered based on how strong each matchup is against Technical Shigaraki, though placements may change as strategies, tuning options, and player optimization evolve.

| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch101_00.png" width="125"><img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch100_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Support/Revenge Assault** <br>These are currently Technical Shigaraki’s strongest special tunings. When run together, they push Tech Shigaraki’s durability to extreme levels, to the point where a large portion of the cast struggles to deal meaningful damage. The combination massively amplifies both sustain and damage reduction, often making him functionally unkillable without coordinated team combos. To illustrate this, consider a level 9 Full Bullet Alpha, which is commonly used as a high-DPS benchmark. A single shot deals roughly 100 damage. With Revenge Assault active, incoming damage is reduced by 20%, lowering this to 80 damage per shot. Shigaraki is typically knocked down after two hits, for a total of 160 damage. After being knocked down, Shigaraki gains roughly five seconds of invincibility. During this time, Gamma restores 6 HP and 6 GP per tick, while Revenge Support restores an additional 7 HP per tick. Over five ticks, this adds up to roughly 100 total HP and GP restored before he even stands up. As a result, Full Bullet’s effective sustained damage is reduced to around 60, and this does not account for healing gained during active combat or any missed shots. This calculation also ignores base defense tuning and the ability to run support cards in the lower slots to increase healing further when needed. When all of this is combined, Shigaraki becomes nearly impossible to kill unless he is eliminated in a single, highly optimized team combo, with rare exceptions such as Nagant and, in some cases, Technical Mirio.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch007_01.png" width="125"> | **Electrification** <br>As shown in the combo section, Electrification dramatically enhances Shigaraki’s combo potential. Since Shigaraki can see enemy GP and HP values, he can precisely determine when to force a guardbreak and capitalize on it. This tuning allows him to abuse Alpha’s low-down power, safely incorporate Beta despite its startup, and access high-damage routes that are otherwise impossible for combos.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch024_01.png" width="125"> | **Critical Permeation** <br> Because Technical Shigaraki frequently gets guardbroken during fights due to Gamma’s passive GP restoration, Critical Permeation is a powerful option. While it has a 30-second cooldown, it activates more often on Tech Shigaraki than on much of the cast. When it triggers, Shigaraki becomes invincible for roughly seven seconds. During this time, Gamma restores 6 HP and 6 GP per second at level 9, and Revenge Support adds 7 HP per second. Over the duration, this results in 42 GP and 91 HP restored from those effects alone. This window also allows Shigaraki to safely use healing items or shields, making the tuning extremely reliable. While not as overwhelmingly strong as the Revenge Support and Revenge Assault pairing, Critical Permeation excels at protecting Shigaraki from high burst damage that could otherwise kill him quickly, such as a Nagant headshot followed by Alpha.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch017_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Technical** <br>As mentioned earlier, Technical Shigaraki gets guardbroken frequently due to Gamma’s constant GP regeneration. This makes Revenge-based tunings especially valuable, as they remain active for a large portion of each fight. Revenge Technical grants a 1.5x reload speed bonus, which is incredibly impactful despite Shigaraki already having short cooldowns. At max level and without cooldown penalties, Beta’s cooldown drops from 4.5 seconds to 3 seconds, while Alpha’s cooldown drops from 2 seconds to roughly 1.3 seconds.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch201_00.png" width="125"> | **Quirk Factor Release** <br>Quirk Factor Release has a cooldown and activates less frequently than Revenge Technical, but its effect is significantly more substantial. On activation, it provides a 2x reload speed bonus after guardbreaking an enemy, which happens often with Technical Shigaraki. With this active, Alpha’s cooldown drops to around 1.3 seconds, while Beta drops to roughly 2.25 seconds, allowing Shigaraki to rapidly reposition and maintain offensive pressure.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_01.png" width="125"> | **Space Hop** <br>Space Hop is a strong mobility option for Technical Shigaraki. The increased jump height allows him to reach more positions with Collapse Hand, set up better Beta angles, or pressure opponents from above with Alpha (though that one is not always recommended). The extra height also synergizes well with Gamma, enabling safer activation or an easier air-stalling setup. However, this tuning makes Shigaraki more vulnerable to characters that punish airborne opponents, so it should be used deliberately rather than spammed.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch005_00.png" width="125"> | **Wall Runner** <br>Wall Runner provides strong mobility and unpredictability. Compared to the Beta movement, wall running is harder for opponents to read, allowing Shigaraki to outmaneuver enemies more effectively. There is also tech that allows Shigaraki to hold Beta while wall running, but the primary value of this tuning lies in the added movement options and evasiveness it provides.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch003_00.png" width="125"> | **Revenge Rapid** <br>Revenge Rapid remains a viable option due to its frequent activation, but its impact is noticeably weaker than other Revenge tunings. Alpha and Beta gain very little (if any) benefit from the attack speed increase, and the main advantages come from slightly faster movement and access to wall running.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch026_00.png" width="125"> | **Ability Manifest** <br>Because Gamma already provides strong sustain and defensive value, Ability Manifest further amplifies Shigaraki’s ability to remain in prolonged fights. The 1.6x boost to ability cards synergizes well with his playstyle, giving him additional tools during extended engagements.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch001_01.png" width="125"><img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch102_00.png" width="125"><img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch037_00.png" width="125"> | **Kota Finder/Divine Protection/Card Duplication** <br>These tunings help Technical Shigaraki level up faster. Thanks to his strong mobility, he can reach Kota spawns and supply boxes earlier than many characters. Card Duplication in particular accelerates early leveling, which significantly improves his survivability and damage output in the early game.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch104_00.png" width="125"> | **Fixer** <br>On optimized builds, Fixer can provide a meaningful damage increase. Since Shigaraki’s attacks hit multiple times, the added damage scales well across his kit. Some builds that leverage this tuning are outlined later.|

While not essential, Plus Chaos synergizes well with Gamma, allowing him to stay in fights longer and further amplify his already strong sustain.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch008_01.png" width="125"> | **Willpower** <br>Willpower is a solid defensive option that helps prevent sudden deaths from high burst damage. However, it requires careful disengagement once it activates, as poor positioning afterward can still result in being punished.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch023_00.png" width="125"> | **PU Power Intensified** <br>This tuning significantly increases Shigaraki’s damage output. When combined with Gamma during Plus Chaos, Shigaraki gains max shield, shield regeneration, HP regeneration, and a substantial damage boost at the same time. The main downside is that the Plus Chaos duration is reduced by roughly five seconds, making timing and decision-making more critical.|
| <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/roleslots/T_ui_UniqueSkill_ch115_00.png" width="125"> | **Quick Reload** <br>This tuning sounds strong on paper, but in practice, it is not optimal. With builds that use Revenge Technical or Quirk Factor Release, Technical Shigaraki already has sufficiently fast Alpha reloads and improved cooldowns across his kit to safely maintain pressure. Alpha’s endlag is already relatively low, so further investment into its reload speed provides diminishing returns. Because of this, dedicating an entire special tuning slot to the effect is inefficient for Tech Shigaraki, especially when its activation condition requires downing an opponent, making it far less consistent than alternatives that provide value throughout the entire fight.|

### Budget Builds
**Builds that aren't PUR and are cheaper with some decent effects if you want to test out tuning or not spend too much on PUR outfits.**

### PUR Builds
**These are complete builds with good special tuning slots (with some regard to normal tuning as well). He has a lot of good builds, but I'm mainly going to focus on ones around his top 10 good special tunings while trying to have some for each PUR set.**

            <p>A decent budget build option that can run Special Attack Reload Boost/Revenge Technical/Critical Permeation/HP Sucker and Full Burn/Symbol of Peace but do keep in mind that the effectiveness of all of these will be reduced due to the low max level of Special Tuning Slots on non-PUR outfits. Out of all the Technical options Special Attack Reload Boost would be preferred due to still providing decent value even at lower levels.</p>

## Izuku Midoriya (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch001/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch001_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Izuku doesn’t really have anything too threatening to use against you. You can fly out of his beta range, Blackwhip is hard to land, and alpha while being his best Quirk Skill can’t do much if it’s the only thing he can use to attack you with. Just out beam him or use tricky movement if you’re close to avoid his damage and land your combos on him.

## Izuku Midoriya (Full Bullet) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch001var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Full Bullet’s alpha is much more powerful than Assault Izuku’s, but that’s all he has going for him if you’re in the air. Full Bullet’s beta is incredibly inconsistent to land on aerial enemies and gamma can only really be used to match your height. You can’t really out beam a character who can do 200 damage with two alphas however, and getting close to him makes you liable to getting combo’d, so this a battle where if you can’t go higher than his alpha’s range and fire back at him you must get close and bait his beta and gamma so you can perform your own combos on him. Drone Anima can also be used to prevent his beta from doing massive damage if you use it before Full Bullet’s beta connects onto the ground.

## Izuku Midoriya OFA <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch202_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
This is a fight where whoever lands the most combos wins. Izuku using the apex of One For All is fast, hard to hit, and has very annoying to deal with attacks. Thankfully, Drone Anima can be used to make this pest sit in place for you to wallop him. He also has very punishable end lag after he uses beta so if you can either roll and punish or go up into the air and punish if he uses Quintuple. He also has some start up whenever he uses gamma and if you roll his lock on correctly that’s another free punish for you. However, this is all assuming he hasn’t gotten the chance to rush you down as once that happens you’re in for a rough time unless you have your drones ready and waiting. A weird property Drone Anima has with Izuku’s lock on gamma is if you tap the drones when hit by his gamma the drones will not shoot out but if you HOLD the drones they will shoot out. TLDR: Hold gamma when One For All Deku hits you with his gamma to stagger him out of the punch and you’ll avoid a big chunk of damage.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Bakugo can’t really do much to you once you’re in the air. His beta is incredibly hard to land on aerial enemies and Bakugo has to spend his precious Special Action to match your height to use gamma. The thing is, you can just use tap Special Action or go higher to get out of range of gamma. As long as you keep your distance and don’t let him get the jump on you this fight should be a cinch.

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Machine Gun is an entirely different beast however. He is incredibly fast, evasive, and does really solid damage. Unless you are incredibly accurate with your aim this character will be a massive headache as trying to kill a mosquito that can delete fair amounts of your health bar relatively quickly is not a fight you’d want to take in general if possible. Best thing you can do against Machine Gun is punish his gamma end lag and get as much damage as possible then. Drone Anima is also a decent way to get him to sit still for you and could turn the fight around as his low HP makes your combos even more devastating against him. Problem is with using your drones however is Machine Gun is incredibly fast and depending on his speed and your angle on him hitting drones on him could prove to be challenging. If Machine Gun decides to try and trade alphas with you you barely win the trade so a better option would be to take the chance to stagger him with drones and combo him off the stagger.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Another mosquito that can delete your health except she can do it even faster if she lands a gamma on you. Thankfully, she has decent end lag at the end of her beta and gamma so punish those moves if she misses them. Try to stay off the floor as much as possible as getting hit by Ochaco’s gamma is a very easy way to lose the fight right then and there. There’s enough end lag to get a freeze off on her if you can evade her gamma which is a very good way to get some damage on her as Armored All Might’s freeze combos are his deadliest but the timing is pretty tight. Your drones are another massive asset you have against Ochaco to keep her in place but depending on how fast she’s moving and your angle to her she could dodge the drones using her crazy mobility. A key part of surviving her if you do get hit by her gamma is to stagger her with your drones as this will buy you enough time move out of her gamma and either continue fighting her or run away.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Zero Satellites does have a very hard hitting charged alpha, but she can’t really do much to you if you keep your distance. Her regular alpha is a slow moving projectile you can get out of the way of, beta can be some trouble but nothing your drones can’t stun her out of, and her gamma  is only threatening if you’re on the ground. Don’t worry about her using her charge gamma to heal as you have more than enough mobility to catch her up there. Just keep in mind that if you get close she does have a charged alpha that can do some decent damage on you.

## Tenya Iida <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch005/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch005_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Iida if you let him get the jump on you can be really oppressive and hard to shake off. Depending on how good the Iida’s movement is, landing drones on him could prove to be difficult, but getting some height on him forces him to use some alphas and betas to match your height which gets rid of some of his pressure. Once his Recipro runs out that’s when you want to rain the pain on him as he is incredibly vulnerable in this state. This fight revolves around whether or not you can survive under pressure if he gets the jump on you and if you get the jump on him how long you can pressure him with beta and gamma to keep him in place for you and your team. Do keep in mind that Iida has armor on his beta meaning your drones cannot stagger him out of it so whenever Iida goes for a beta focus on dodging it instead of staggering him out of it.<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Todoroki’s two most threatening moves in beta and gamma are stuck to being grounded moves meaning that staying in the air is the play to shut him down. If he tries to bait you into a building it is generally not worth the risk of following him as this character can absolutely eviscerate you if he’s in a small space with you.

Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ice Fang Wind Flame has the same counterplay as Strike Todoroki with the addition of never following this version into a building as he’s even more of a menace inside small spaces than Strike Todoroki unless you know he’s beaten and battered. Ice Fang Wind Flame can also hide inside of the fire pillars spawned by his gamma if he doesn’t want to risk getting hit by your alphas or drones, but this isn’t generally an issue as he also can’t really do much to you in this state because he has to keep spamming gammas if he wants to keep the tornadoes up.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Tsuyu is a slippery foe, but drones can usually shut down her tricky movement. If you see her trying to get a beta on you while you’re in the air try to dash out of the range of her beta with Special Action and punish with a beta of your own. On the ground it's the same idea except you can just dodge roll instead of dashing with Special Action. It’s easier to get the beta off if you stun with drones first as her end lag on beta isn’t the slowest but it gives you enough time to get something going. If you do get hit by her beta you can simply fire back with drones and use your own beta on her as a punish.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Stay in the air and this guy can do literally nothing to you. If you HAVE to fight him up close however try to bait his alpha and beta by rolling behind him and punishing the end lag, and for gamma get some height to avoid the lingering hit box as the hit box lingers for quite a while. Blackbolt can keep Kirishima in place even while he’s Hardened which can help in case you need a breather from his beta spam in a closed space. Do keep in mind that while Kirishima has Hardening active your drones cannot stagger him easily so don't rely on them too much for staggers during this fight.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴🔴Extremely Unfavorable🔴🔴🔴<br>
Red Drive can do ludicrous amounts of damage in a ludicrously short amount of time and has the tools to follow you if you don’t use your entire arsenal to get away from him. Red Drive’s alpha lets him get some decent movement and is a combo starter, his beta is an incredibly annoying shield and massive AOE damage if you’re on the ground, and his gamma has him throw a rock that has a stupidly long lingering hit box, does good damage, knocks you down in two hits, and Red Drive is armored during the throw. There’s not really a reliable way to stun him as his shield is very good, he attacks fast, has insane movement that can make it hard for your drones or beta to connect, and Hardening makes your drones have a much harder time staggering him. He does have an opening when he uses his gamma so if you can capitalize on that that can get you some nice damage unless he has Hardening active This is a rough fight whether you’re in or outdoors and you should not take this foe lightly.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Flying into the air makes Momo absolutely defenseless against you so if you catch her out in an open area she is positively screwed just rain down alphas on her and she’ll be dead. It is ill-advised to follow her inside of a building unless she is almost dead as this is where Momo thrives since her cannons are very good deterrents and she can use her shields to block off entrances and exits to keep you trapped if she’s smart enough.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Same deal as most other characters just fly up and most of his damage is gone. As always when fighting Denki be careful fighting close quarters against him as one mistimed roll can lead to deadly damage on you if you do not have your drones up. Denki’s Special Action makes it harder for you to perform combos where you have to be close to him, but you can perform proper spacing with alpha and gamma to take him down. If Denki tries to use beta or gamma on you you can beta or gamma him right back, and if Denki does manage to land a gamma on you you can use your drones to stagger him to prevent the alpha spam that usually follows after his gamma.

Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Lightning has almost every tool to deal with you. Want to get in close for combos? Mines and Special Action. Want to beam him from out of the sky? He can beam you right back. Want to run away using your Special Action or beta? If there’s no line of sight blockers he’s got you in his sights. His mines can also block your drones which makes it even harder to get in and start something against him. Your best bet is to start attacking him before he notices that you’re getting close otherwise it’ll be hard to get in against Lightning. Thankfully, if Lightning does not have his Special Action up he shoots alphas much slower, and if he does have Special Action up he'll only be able to get one or two fully charged alphas off before your alphas knock him down.

The unpredictability of Monoma makes it hard to determine whether or not he’s a threat to you, but Armored All Might is incredibly versatile and can handle most of the tricks he has up his sleeves. If he tries running you have the mobility to chase him down so this fight is more you keeping track of what Quirks he’s Copied so you can plan your strategy accordingly.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Kendo is absolutely screwed as soon as you enter the sky as the only thing she can do is hold her shield up and look for cover. If you must fight Kendo in a close-quarters environment then stay out of melee range with tap Special Action and beta and try to bait out gamma so you can punish with your combos.
<br>

Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Twin Palm Strike has just as many combos as you do and the mobility to catch up with you if you don’t have Special Action to run away with. Her alpha can make it incredibly annoying to get in or out but you do have drones to cover that option and you can punish with alpha if she misses, her beta can be a problem if you don’t have beta off cooldown to kick her out of it so don’t use beta recklessly against her as doing so will rid you of your option against her beta. Gamma is too fast moving for the drones to track properly if she’s strafing on the ground but in the air assuming you’re close enough it should be enough to stagger her. If Twin Palm Strike manages to hit her gamma finisher on you she is armored during it so you cannot stun her out of it with drones. This fight is determined by who can bait out the other person’s important cooldowns first.
<br>

## Ibara Shiozaki <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch102/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch102_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Ibara does a lot of damage if you let her get close to you or if she lands a few good alphas but you have the mobility to easily bait and evade her. Just bait and dodge her alpha and beta with your own alphas and betas and this fight should be quick and easy. If you get grabbed by her gamma your drones do not track her properly so you're pretty much screwed at that point. If you see an Ibara that's caught one of your teammates in her gamma make sure to use beta on her as she has armor during her gamma meaning drones will not stagger her easily and she'll be much harder to freeze with Ice Bullet Shot.

## Mirio Togata (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch024/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch024_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Most of the things Mirio can do are things that you can roll since his charged alpha and beta have a lot of start up. His gamma and uncharged alpha come out quick and can definitely connect if you don’t expect them, but one missed attack from him means you automatically win the fight as one of your combos or even firing a few Flame Bullet Shots at him is enough for most Mirios to leave the fight right then and there. If you know a Mirio is around keep an eye on your surroundings and potential charged alpha jump scare spots and remember that whenever Mirio is using his beta he makes an audible noise giving away his location letting you know if you should be ready to dodge roll or not. This will limit the chances he has to get the jump on you which is what Mirio thrives on. Performing riskier combos on enemy Mirios isn't recommended since he can use Special Action to break out of combos very easily and the down time on most of the riskier combos is more than enough for him to use Special Action to escape it.
<br>

## Mirio Togata (Sheer Counter) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch024var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴🔴Extremely Unfavorable🔴🔴🔴<br>
This character is way too much even for the versatile Armored All Might. Sheer Counter has more i-frames than Rapid Mirio does on all of his moves, he can attack WHILE those i-frames are active on ALL of his Quirk Skills whereas Rapid Mirio can only do that after a charged alpha, and has the titular counter he can use on REACTION to most moves in the game all of Armored All Might’s Quirk Skills included. You’ll be lucky to get a hit in if Sheer Counter is using alpha, and you can’t risk attacking him when he’s not in the middle of an attack because of counter, so the only choice you have in most situations is pray he uses beta and misses as the end of beta has consistently long end lag that you can use to punish. Sheer Counter also has some end lag at the end of their counter but Sheer Counter has a bug that makes the i-frames from the counter last longer than intended so the window is pretty tight to punish him if he doesn’t activate a counter. Overall, this fight is a mess and one that you should try to take with your team if possible so you can overwhelm him with numbers. Due to this character’s Special Action and counter doing riskier combos is ill advised as he can either break out of them with permeation or hit you with a counter since both of these moves come out very quick and the downtime between your attacks during the riskier combos is more than enough for him to perform either of these actions.

## Tamaki Amajiki <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch026_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Tamaki’s main source of damage is from his combos that start with grabbing you with alpha which won’t be a problem as long as you use dodge rolls and tap Special Action efficiently. Tamaki does get a lot of chances to grab you however, and a good one will stop trying to go for grabs and start poking you with his unaimed alpha if he notices you’re dodging all his grabs, and when this happens you want to switch from dodging and weaving in alphas to getting out of his alpha range so you can try and start a combo. The reason you can’t try to get out of his alpha range when he’s going for grabs is because he’ll just grab you before you can escape. Drones do hard counter his combo attempts so having drones up against Tamaki is very important.
<br>

## Nejire Hado <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch025/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch025_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
You have more movement, combo potential, and burst damage than Nejire. Since Nejire doesn’t have a way to go up besides using gamma you can attempt to perform an air bash combo on her by going directly above her and using beta, but you’d need to start the fight at a height advantage as if you try to do this mid-fight she’ll just dash away. Making her dash away does however make it easy for you to beam her or perform one of the combos you’d use for an aerial enemy caught in Blackphane. Generally though, just match her height and try to dodge her slow moving projectiles and this fight should be an easy win.

## Hitoshi Shinso <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch105_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Both Armored All Might and Shinso are great in a 1v1 so this fight is more so who can keep up the most pressure since a missed attack on Shinso’s end is a big punish for you while a mistimed roll on your end is also a big punish for him. Shinso’s alpha can grab you out of all of your options and once he does grab you your drones bug out and don’t track him properly like with Ibara's gamma so it’s harder to get out of his combos. Harder, not impossible because your drones will track properly after Shinso slams you so if you get hit by Shinso’s alpha wait until after you get slammed to stagger with drones. Unfortunately, if the Shinso goes for beta right after he alphas he’ll be able to hit the beta before your drones hit him and you lose the damage trade. Dodging while trying to stagger Shinso with drones will be key in winning this encounter.

## All Might (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch012/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch012_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Everything All Might can do has a decent amount of start up/end lag so as long as you can dodge his laggy moves you should be all good. All Might’s gamma can block all the attacks you can do, but he does have a bit of lag after so just be patient and strike when he’s vulnerable. If he tries to Special Action away you can use beta to grab him out of it but if he does get it off you have more than enough mobility to chase if it’s appropriate to do so.
<br>

## All Might (Gatling) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch012var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Gatling has really good movement with beta, burst damage with gamma, and a really nice armored move in alpha. Thankfully, his burst damage can be avoided by keeping your distance, and his alpha you can grab him out of with beta. Do keep in mind that since Gatling is armored during alpha he will take many more Ice Bullet Shots to freeze and even 4 drones is not enough to stagger him so using beta to kick him out of alpha would be your best bet if you wish to fight him. If you have your drones out and Gatling hits you with gamma you can shoot two drones to stagger him out of it if you’re quick enough, but if you’re too late you’re eating the gamma damage as the drones cannot track him well and he gets armor after he leaps into the air. Gatling is actually able to keep up with you thanks to his insane movement with beta meaning that if you try to run away from him you're most likely going to get chased. However, this applies to Gatling as well so if you see him trying to run away, and you chasing him won't screw over your team, give chase to make sure the Symbol of Peace stays down.

A mirror match so the better player wins. To get an edge over your evil clone move unpredictably and if you know you’re about to get hit by two or more drones shoot two drones back and since you’ll be staggered first you’ll recover first meaning you can punish the other Armored All Might. If the other Armored All Might tries to get a height advantage either match his height, grapple from below and combo him from there, or stagger them with drones.

## Shota Aizawa <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch013/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch013_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Aizawa, like Shinso, is incredibly good in a 1v1 and even more so if the Aizawa knows what he’s doing. It is imperative that you have drones up before an Aizawa starts his onslaught as if you have your drones out and Aizawa erases your Quirk you can still shoot drones. Aizawa’s gamma can block all of your Quirk Skills so don’t bother wasting time trying to hit him through it and instead use this time to reposition into a more favorable spot. The same drone bugginess with Shinso’s alpha also occurs with Aizawa’s alpha so make sure you wait until he pulls you in before you shoot your drones for a stagger. Your drones are actually a very nice tool against Aizawa since it can break his flow and mess up his combos enough for you to get an edge in. This fight will definitely take some focus to get through but it is entirely possible to win the 1v1.

## Present Mic <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch109/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch109_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Mic’s damage is simply too much to handle even with all of your tools. You can’t out beam him because his alpha and beta with boomboxes do way too much and you can’t get close to him because he’ll just tap beta into gamma for a free guard break. You do have drones, but that’s your only reliable way to get in unless you are really confident with trying to hit betas while constant 300 damage hit boxes are barreling towards your direction. Try to keep your distance and stagger Mic with drones before you go in for the kill to prevent taking massive amounts of burst damage.

Difficulty Score: 🔴🔴Very Unfavorable🔴🔴<br>
Cementoss can create cover on demand which is really unfortunate for someone who’s biggest weakness is the enemy having cover. If you try to get close to Cementoss or he sees you he’s most likely going to put up some walls and make it very hard for you to keep being close to him. You do have the height advantage with your Special Action, but he can create cover from aerial foes so it’s hard to get in from the air as well. When Cementoss pillars up with his alpha, that's your chance to strike by matching his height and either shooting at him or comboing him. If possible try to stay in the air or at least have high ground on him to make it harder for him to attack you and if he covers his head with gamma and you need to continue fighting him get on the ground but do not get too close to him as every Quirk Skill he has can deal with close range enemies.

## Endeavor (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch023/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch023_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Endeavor has a slower flight than you, less air time than you, and he requires a lot more mechanical skill from the opponent to perform well. That being said it’s important to always stay on the move against an Endeavor as making him miss his alphas and betas is crucial to weakening Endeavor’s damage output. Do also keep in mind when chasing Endeavor that he can throw betas in a way to cover doorways and hallways so try not to fall for this when chasing him. If Endeavor tries to run away you have more than enough movement to catch up to him so the main thing to worry about with this fight is avoiding his attacks while trying to get in with your beta and drones.
<br>

## Endeavor (Inferno Fist) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch023var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Inferno Fist generally stays in the air while he uses his abilities which makes him a very easy target for you to latch onto with beta or stun with your drones. If you are hit by Inferno Fist’s beta you can fly up and away from it, and if you are hit by Inferno Fist’s gamma on GP you just have to take the damage as his gamma stuns you in place if hit on GP with your only option being to shoot out your drones to get some damage in and stagger. Remember to hold down gamma to shoot all your remaining drones since tapping gamma shoots the drones weirdly if caught in his gamma. If you are hit on HP by his gamma you can either use tap Special Action to get some distance from Inferno Fist before the gamma puts you into a hard knockdown or use your drones to stagger him to prevent any follow-ups from Inferno FIst. If you decide on the drone option then make sure you stagger him twice with 4 drones with two being shot as he shoots his gamma, and two being shot after the first stagger ends. This will prevent him from following up with alpha or beta so less pressure is on you. If you can then you should obviously stagger him before the gamma is shot out so you don’t have to worry about it in the first place but if you are hit by it you aren’t out of options (if you have drones up that is). Getting a height advantage on Inferno Fist will also put him at a disadvantage so aim for that if possible.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
Hawks can be tricky to land hits on if manages to land a beta on you, but otherwise he’s not a huge threat. While he has wings he cannot use them to get a height advantage over you without wasting beta or gamma charges so getting a height advantage puts more pressure on him to waste those Quirk Skills for movement. As long as you’re making good use of tap Special Action Hawks’s alpha will have a hard time hitting you as well. Other than that it’s the same as usual which means using alpha and looking for an opening to combo off of or making your own with gamma.
<br>

## Hawks (Slicing Wind) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch043var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Slicing Wind has more movement, damage and combos compared to Rapid Hawks making him a much bigger threat. When Slicing Wind has a level 7 or higher his hold beta has armor during the start of it meaning you cannot use drones to stagger him out of the start of his beta, but you can stagger him after the dash of his beta preventing him from comboing off of beta. Using your drones to break out of Slicing Wind’s gamma is also a key part in winning against him. Keeping a height advantage will force Slicing Wind to use their Quirk Skills to match your height, but do take care to not go too high as Slicing Wind’s tap alpha stagger loops can be devastating for your health. Make sure you take advantage of the long end lag Slicing Wind has after using hold alpha and beta by using your own betas to combo off his end lag. Having good aim against Slicing Wind is very important as this character is very quick and can be hard to hit.

Another case of getting a height advantage over her makes her unable to do anything to you. Her alpha has short range, her beta can’t hit aerial targets, and her gamma doesn’t have that much travel distance. If she is using her Special Action it is advised to not use beta against her as you will either be pulled towards a kick/stomp or do minimal damage as you cannot stun her in place or stagger with drones when she is in her Special Action.

None of his Quirk Skills can hit aerial enemies so a height advantage just wins you the fight. Shigaraki can use his Special Action upwards to get some height so as long as you avoid that range you should be fine. If you must fight this character inside of a building try to stay in the air and use alphas to freeze to prevent him from using Special Action to hit you.

Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢<br>
While Catastrophe has a way to move up it’s not a reliable way to hit you. Same things said about Strike Shigaraki apply here as well but just be careful about getting too close to the ground as the punishment for doing so is much worse than with Strike Shigaraki due to the insane damage combos Catastrophe has access to.

## Tomura Shigaraki (Thousand-Hand Break) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch015var2_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Thousand-Hand Break’s moves all have a decent amount of start up and end lag so catching his openings shouldn’t be hard, just beta him once you dodge his alpha or beta if you have line of sight on him. If you’re above him he has a much harder time aiming his alpha and beta to hit you so make sure to get a height advantage over him if possible. His gamma combined with certain T.U.N.I.N.G. builds makes him nigh immortal which makes him much harder to kill but still has the same drawbacks mentioned already. Thousand-Hand Break doesn’t have armor on any of his Quirk Skills as well so using drones to kick him out of his Quirk Skills can be really nice especially gamma as preventing him from activating it makes him much easier to kill. As a side note make sure you pay attention to the green indicator on your screen as that means a Thousand-Hand Break is currently using Search and sees you though this also applies to when Aizawa uses Erasure on you.

## All For One (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch016/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch016_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢Very Favorable🟢🟢/🟣Unknown🟣<br>
Depending on the Quirks All For One has plundered from someone this match-up could swing in multiple different ways. If All For One is using his base Quirks then there isn’t too much to worry about as if you’re in the air when he decides to use gamma you can fly up faster than it takes his gamma to pull you in, his alpha isn’t too threatening and you win the beamer 1v1, and his beta can’t hit you in the air easily. If you do happen to be grabbed by him, get ready to shoot drones at him to prevent any follow-ups. Just pay attention during this fight as without knowing what his second set of Quirks are it’s hard to have a proper gameplan.

## All For One -Youth age- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch201_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Young All For One doesn’t have anything crazy threatening he can use against you. His alpha is good but without the extra damage he gets from the explosion it’s nothing crazy, his beta can knock you and let him get an alpha or Special Action off which can be scary especially if he seals your Special Action, and gamma if not avoided properly can let him loop you with it until the big explosion at the end. If you are in the air his alpha does less damage so being in the air is preferable, and you can use tap Special Action to avoid his beta as the further away you are from the start of his beta the more time it’ll take to reach you, and to avoid the gamma loop if you get hit wait a bit to make use of i-frames, fly up quickly, and then grab him with beta since your beta can kick him out of his gamma. Do not attempt to use drones when he is in his gamma as he has armor during it and 4 drones won’t be enough to stagger him. At all costs try to avoid getting hit by his Special Action because once your Special Action is sealed you lose a lot of pressure you would've otherwise had against Young All For One.

## Dabi (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch017/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch017_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Dabi’s alpha is too slow to hit you reliably and his beta and gamma do nothing to you in the air. Trying to combo a Dabi near his mines is ill-advised as you’ll either hit a mine and waste beta charges or latch onto Dabi but get hit by his mines. Fighting this character inside a building is also ill-advised as his gamma can make it hard to get in since it blocks all of your options and a good Dabi will have trapped the inside of his gamma to prevent people from rolling inside of it.

## Dabi (Crazy Torch) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch017var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Crazy Torch cannot do much of anything to you while you’re in the air as long as you are outside of his beta’s range. Make sure when you dodge his beta to punish him with your own beta.  

## Himiko Toga (Default) <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch018/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch018_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Toga’s mobility is really good for how much damage she can do with her alpha and beta. Toga’s beta isn’t too much of a problem if you’re in the air, but that leaves you open into getting beamed by her alpha where she can do similar amounts of damage to you if you try to out beam her. If you’re close to her it would instead be better to try and freeze her instead of trying to out damage her with alpha as a freeze will let you perform a combo that can do a lot of damage to her. If you are farther away it would be better to move unpredictably and hit her with your Flame Bullet Shots to knock her down so you can reposition into a better spot for a beta. If Toga hits you with her beta you can use your drones to stagger her out of the dash hit which will prevent you from taking a lot of damage. Toga also has a lot of end lag after she uses gamma which lets you either freeze her or beta her for a combo depending on how far away you are from Toga.

## Himiko Toga (Sting Dance) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch018var1_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢Favorable🟢<br>
Watch out for her betas whenever you’re below Sting Dance as she can combo that into beta for more damage or gamma to take your blood easily. Her alpha can also pile on some damage if you’re not moving around a lot so trying to stay in the air and use Flame Bullet Shots isn’t advised. Playing grounded will most likely end with you getting beta’d, but staying in the air will most likely get you hit by either alpha or gamma, so your best option would be to fly up into the air, make her waste alphas and gammas trying to chase you, and while she’s chasing you beta her to start a combo. Alternatively, if you manage to catch Sting Dance's gamma end lag that is a very free combo for you since her gamma has very long end lag for a movement tool. You can also use drones to stop her from performing a combo off of beta if she does end up getting the jump on you.

## Twice <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch037/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch037_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Twice’s alpha has good range and can hit you even when you’re high up but that’s kinda all he has. His gamma is not very good mobility at all and while his beta does create an extra enemy to shoot at, its aim isn’t the best. Getting a height advantage over Twice basically confines him to using alpha which you do better than him so he just dies.
<br>

## Mr. Compress <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch038/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch038_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Compress can do good damage to you if he manages to catch you out while having very good mobility at gamma level 9. His beta also either reflects or blocks all of your options meaning you HAVE to fight him up close which can be uncomfortable in tight corridors or small buildings where his trucks have a hard time missing you. Thankfully, your melee is very good and can very easily hit him quickly if meleeing after Special Action, and if he’s throwing trucks at you he can’t pull up beta to block your drones, but without drones this fight becomes a bit tricky. Your drones and beta can also force Compress out of his marble when he uses gamma meaning if you’re in the air when Compress decides to gamma you can chase him and use drones to stagger him out of his marble for a free punish. 
<br>

## Overhaul <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch034/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch034_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟢🟢🟢Extremely Favorable🟢🟢🟢<br>
Overhaul cannot do much of anything to you while you’re in the air so flying above him is preferred. If you have to fight him on the ground make sure to roll his gamma and counter with drones so you can use a beta afterwards for big damage.
<br>

## Kurogiri <img src="https://ultrarumble.com/assets/Character/Ch103/GUI/FaceIcon/T_ui_Ch103_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🟡Even🟡<br>
Kurogiri will have a hard time landing hits on you, but you’ll also have a hard time hitting Kurogiri if he uses his portals effectively. Being in the air makes Kurogiri have a harder time hitting you with alpha and beta but take care not to hover in place as that gives Kurogiri a free quadruple beta combo for massive damage on you. Hitting Kurogiri with drones to keep him in place will make it much easier to do damage to him as otherwise you’ll have to keep chasing him through portals to do damage to him which is incredibly annoying and separates you from your team. 

## Lady Nagant <img src="ttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/HydrosPlays/ultrarumbleguide/main/images/T_ui_Ch115_profile.png" width="70"/>
Difficulty Score: 🔴Unfavorable🔴<br>
Lady Nagant can do insane amounts of burst damage with her Special Action so if you see a purple laser, RUN. If she does miss her Special Action then she loses almost all of her pressure on you, but she still wins the alpha trade by a considerable amount of damage. So, instead of trying to win the alpha trade you should either stagger her with drones or use beta and combo her from there so she doesn't have a chance to win the alpha trade. Thankfully, if you can react fast enough you are able to use tap Special Action to dash out of her beta range, or if you are hit by her beta you can shoot drones to stagger her before she can get a shot off. Trying to hover against a Nagant is very ill-advised as that makes you incredibly prone to alpha spam and/or your head getting split open like a watermelon from Special Action. If you see her performing a gamma that's a very free beta or gamma for you since her gamma has some start up, and if she's in the air you can gamma her for free to stagger her in place for a beta as well if you aren't confident with your beta aim. Most important thing to remember in this match-up is to stay vigilant as one headshot on you instantly loses you the fight.
